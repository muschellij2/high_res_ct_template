	abstract = {Computed tomographic ({CT}) images are widely used for the identification of abnormal brain tissue following infarct and hemorrhage in stroke. Manual lesion delineation is currently the standard approach, but is both time-consuming and operator-dependent. To address these issues, we present a method that can automatically delineate infarct and hemorrhage in stroke {CT} images. The key elements of this method are the accurate normalization of {CT} images from stroke patients into template space and the subsequent voxelwise comparison with a group of control {CT} images for defining areas with hypo- or hyper-intense signals. Our validation, using simulated and actual lesions, shows that our approach is effective in reconstructing lesions resulting from both infarct and hemorrhage and yields lesion maps spatially consistent with those produced manually by expert operators. A limitation is that, relative to manual delineation, there is reduced sensitivity of the automated method in regions close to the ventricles and the brain contours. However, the automated method presents a number of benefits in terms of offering significant time savings and the elimination of the inter-operator differences inherent to manual tracing approaches. These factors are relevant for the creation of large-scale lesion databases for neuropsychological research. The automated delineation of stroke lesions from {CT} scans may also enable longitudinal studies to quantify changes in damaged tissue in an objective and reproducible manner.},

	abstract = {Spatial normalization reshapes an individual's brain to match the shape and size of a template image. This is a crucial step required for group-level statistical analyses. The most popular standard templates are derived from {MRI} scans of young adults. We introduce specialized templates that allow normalization algorithms to be applied to stroke-aged populations. First, we developed a {CT} template: while this is the dominant modality for many clinical situations, there are no modern {CT} templates and popular algorithms fail to successfully normalize {CT} scans. Importantly, our template was based on healthy individuals with ages similar to what is commonly seen in stroke (mean 65 years old). This template allows studies where only {CT} scans are available. Second, we derived a {MRI} template that approximately matches the shape of our {CT} template as well as processing steps that aid the normalization of scans from older individuals (including lesion masking and the ability to generate high quality cortical renderings despite brain injury). The benefit of this strategy is that the resulting templates can be used in studies where mixed modalities are present. We have integrated these templates and processing algorithms into a simple {SPM} toolbox (http://www.mricro.com/clinical-toolbox/spm8-scripts).},

  abstract = {Replication of research findings is critical to the progress of scientific understanding. Accordingly, most scientific journals require authors to report experimental procedures in sufficient detail for independent researchers to replicate their work. To what extent do research reports in the functional neuroimaging literature live up to this standard? The present study evaluated methods reporting and methodological choices across 241 recent {fMRI} articles. Many studies did not report critical methodological details with regard to experimental design, data acquisition, and analysis. Further, many studies were underpowered to detect any but the largest statistical effects. Finally, data collection and analysis methods were highly flexible across studies, with nearly as many unique analysis pipelines as there were studies in the sample. Because the rate of false positive results is thought to increase with the flexibility of experimental designs, the field of functional neuroimaging may be particularly vulnerable to false positives. In sum, the present study documented significant gaps in methods reporting among {fMRI} studies. Improved methodological descriptions in research reports would yield significant benefits for the field.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose—The reliability of hematoma volume ({HV}) measurement using the {ABC}/2 method in multicenter clinical trials is unknown. We determined the accuracy of {ABC}/2 method as an on-site test in comparison with the gold standard central {HV}-assessment and semiautomatic {HV}-assessment.
Method—We analyzed data from an acute intracerebral hemorrhage multicenter clinical trial. {HV} was measured by site investigators to determine enrollment eligibility ({\textless}60 cm3) using the {ABC}/2 method (on-site {HV}), and independently by the core-imaging laboratory using computer-based analysis (Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization [{MIPAV}] {HV}). {HV} was also measured by {ABC}/2 method (central {HV}) at the core-imaging laboratory to assess the difference in measurements between on-site (multiple raters with variable experiences) and central (single experienced rater) {HVs}.
Results—Fifty-six subjects were analyzed (mean age 62±15 years; 45\% women). On-site {HV} values showed a significantly lower correlation with the {MIPAV} {HV} (r=0.63) than central {HV} and {MIPAV} {HV} (r=0.93) values. The correlation between on-site {HV} and central {HV} values was modest (r=0.51). A total of 73\% of the central {HVs} were within 25\% of the corresponding {MIPAV} {HVs}, whereas only 46\% of the on-site {HVs} were within 25\% of the corresponding {MIPAV} {HVs} (P{\textless}0.001). One protocol violation occurred as a result of inaccuracy of on-site {HV} measurement.
Conclusion—On-site {HV} measurements showed high variability, but the impact on the eligibility determination was small. Centralized remeasurements of {HVs} with feedback to the sites may increase the reliability of the on-site {HV} measurements.

{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}
Infarct volume is used as a surrogate outcome measure in clinical trials of therapies for acute ischemic stroke. {ABC}/2 is a fast volumetric method, but its accuracy remains to be determined. We aimed to study the accuracy and reproducibility of {ABC}/2 in determining acute infarct volume with diffusion-weighted imaging.
{METHODS}
We studied 86 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke. Three blinded observers determined volume with the {ABC}/2 method, and the results were compared with those of the manual planimetric method.
{RESULTS}
The {ABC}/2 technique overestimated infarct volume by a median false increase (variable {ABC}/2 volume minus planimetric volume) of 7.33 cm3 (1.29, 22.170, representing a 162.56\% increase over the value of the gold standard (variable {ABC}/2 volume over planimetric volume) (121.70, 248.52). In each method, the interrater reliability was excellent: the intraclass correlations were .992 and .985 for the {ABC}/2 technique and planimetric method, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS}
{ABC}/2 is volumetric method with clinical value but it consistently overestimates the real infarct volume. J Neuroimaging 2012;22:155-159},

Test-retest reliability did not differ significantly among a neurologist, a neurology house officer, a neurology nurse, or an emergency department nurse. The stroke scale validity was assessed by comparing the scale scores obtained prospectively on 65 acute stroke patients to the patients' infarction size as measured by computed tomography scan at 1 week and to the patients' clinical outcome as determined at 3 months. These correlations (scale-lesion size r = 0.68, scale-outcome r = 0.79) suggested acceptable examination and scale validity. Of the 15 test items, the most interrater reliable item (pupillary response) had low validity. Less reliable items such as upper or lower extremity motor function were more valid. We discuss methods for improving the reliability and validity of brief examination scales to be used in stroke therapy trials.},

The white matter has been structurally defined in the past only at its core regions (deep white matter).

We used axonal fiber alignment information from diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) to delineate the peripheral white matter, and investigated its relationship with the cortex and the deep white matter. Using {DTI} data from 81 healthy subjects, we identified nine common, blade-like anatomical regions, which were further parcellated into 21 subregions based on the cortical anatomy. Four short association fiber tracts connecting adjacent gyri (U-fibers) were also identified reproducibly among the healthy population.

The present analyses aimed to determine the effects of treatment on hematoma and perihematomal edema over 72 hours.
Methods—{INTERACT} included 404 patients with {CT}-confirmed intracerebral hemorrhage, elevated systolic {BP} (150 to 220 mm Hg), and capacity to start {BP}-lowering treatment within 6 hours of intracerebral hemorrhage. Patients were randomly assigned to an intensive (target systolic {BP} 140 {mmHg}) or standard guideline-based management of {BP} (target systolic {BP} 180 mm Hg) using routine intravenous agents. Baseline and repeat {CTs} (24 and 72 hours) were performed using standardized techniques with digital images analyzed centrally. Outcomes were increases in hematoma and perihematomal edema volumes over 72 hours.
Results—Overall, 296 patients had all 3 {CT} scans available for the hematoma and 270 for the edema analyses. Mean systolic {BP} was 11.7 mm Hg lower in the intensive group than in the guideline group during 1 to 24 hours. Adjusted mean absolute increases in hematoma volumes ({mL}) at 24 and 72 hours were 2.40 and 0.15 in the guideline group compared with −0.74 and −2.31 in the intensive group, respectively, an overall difference of 2.80 (95\% {CI}, 1.04 to 4.56; P=0.002). Adjusted mean absolute increases in edema volumes ({mL}) at 24 and 72 hours were 6.27 and 10.02 in the guideline group compared with 4.19 and 7.34 in the intensive group, respectively, for an overall difference of 2.38 (95\% {CI}, −0.45 to 5.22; P=0.10).
Conclusion—Early intensive {BP}-lowering treatment attenuated hematoma growth over 72 hours in intracerebral hemorrhage. There were no appreciable effects on perihematomal edema.},

Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia ({FTD}) and Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method ({SyN}) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler–Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast {SyN}’s performance with a related elastic method and with the standard {ITK} implementation of Thirion’s Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of {FTD} and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, {SyN}’s volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that {SyN}, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric {MRI} of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

	abstract = {Computed tomographic ({CT}) images are widely used in the diagnosis of stroke. In this paper, we present an automated method to detect and classify an abnormality into acute infarct, chronic infarct and hemorrhage at the slice level of non-contrast {CT} images. The proposed method consists of three main steps: image enhancement, detection of mid-line symmetry and classification of abnormal slices. A windowing operation is performed on the intensity distribution to enhance the region of interest. Domain knowledge about the anatomical structure of the skull and the brain is used to detect abnormalities in a rotation- and translation-invariant manner. A two-level classification scheme is used to detect abnormalities using features derived in the intensity and the wavelet domain. The proposed method has been evaluated on a dataset of 15 patients (347 image slices). The method gives 90\% accuracy and 100\% recall in detecting abnormality at patient level; and achieves an average precision of 91\% and recall of 90\% at the slice level.},

Automatic processing of these {CT} brain scans could speed up the decision making process, lower the cost of healthcare, and reduce the chance of human error. In this paper, we focus on automatic processing of {CT} brain images to segment and identify the ventricular systems. The segmentation of ventricles provides quantitative measures on the changes of ventricles in the brain that form vital diagnosis information.

The computer-based system can be used by medical researchers to observe and quantitatively analyze three-dimensional (3D) changes in {ICH} volume and structure during the course of illness. {CT} head images are first digitized from films and individual slices are aligned. In the following step, the segmentation of {CT} images having {ICH} is performed using a new hybrid method for automatic segmentation. The proposed method has hierarchical structure and is based on unsupervised fuzzy clustering and expert system-based labeling. The hierarchical structure has two levels: the global and the local. The segmented images are interpolated and a quantitative analysis is performed in the final step of the procedure. The quantitative analysis includes the volume measurement of the {ICH} and the edema regions. The system has been used on a number of {CT} head scans and performed correct quantitative analysis},

	abstract = {Computed tomographic ({CT}) images are widely used for the identification of abnormal brain tissue following infarct and hemorrhage in stroke. Manual lesion delineation is currently the standard approach, but is both time-consuming and operator-dependent. To address these issues, we present a method that can automatically delineate infarct and hemorrhage in stroke {CT} images. The key elements of this method are the accurate normalization of {CT} images from stroke patients into template space and the subsequent voxelwise comparison with a group of control {CT} images for defining areas with hypo- or hyper-intense signals. Our validation, using simulated and actual lesions, shows that our approach is effective in reconstructing lesions resulting from both infarct and hemorrhage and yields lesion maps spatially consistent with those produced manually by expert operators. A limitation is that, relative to manual delineation, there is reduced sensitivity of the automated method in regions close to the ventricles and the brain contours. However, the automated method presents a number of benefits in terms of offering significant time savings and the elimination of the inter-operator differences inherent to manual tracing approaches. These factors are relevant for the creation of large-scale lesion databases for neuropsychological research. The automated delineation of stroke lesions from {CT} scans may also enable longitudinal studies to quantify changes in damaged tissue in an objective and reproducible manner.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate short-term case fatality and long-term mortality after intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) and subarachnoid hemorrhage ({SAH}) using data from The Health Improvement Network database.
Methods: Thirty-day case fatality was stratified by age, sex, and calendar year after {ICH} and {SAH} using logistic regression. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to estimate the risk of death during the first year of follow-up and survivors at 1 year.
Results: Case fatality after {ICH} was 42.0\%, compared with 28.7\% after {SAH}. It increased with age ({ICH}: 29.7\% for 20–49 years, 54.6\% for 80–89 years; {SAH}: 20.3\% for 20–49 years, 56.7\% for 80–89 years; both p-trend {\textless} 0.001), and decreased over the period 2000–2001 to 2006–2008 ({ICH}: from 53.1\% to 35.8\%, p-trend {\textless} 0.001; {SAH}: from 33.3\% to 24.7\%, p-trend = 0.02). Risk of death was significantly higher among stroke patients during the first year of follow-up compared with controls ({ICH}: hazard ratio [{HR}] 2.60, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 2.09–3.24, p {\textless} 0.01; {SAH}: {HR} 2.87, 95\% {CI} 2.07–3.97, p {\textless} 0.01) and remained elevated among survivors at 1 year ({ICH}: {HR} 2.02, 95\% {CI} 1.75–2.32, p {\textless} 0.01; {SAH}: {HR} 1.32, 95\% {CI} 1.02–1.69, p = 0.03).
Conclusions: More than one-third of individuals die in the first month after hemorrhagic stroke, and patients younger than 50 years are more likely to die after {ICH} than {SAH}. Short-term case fatality has decreased over time. Patients who survive hemorrhagic stroke have a continuing elevated risk of death compared with matched individuals from the general population.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose—The reliability of hematoma volume ({HV}) measurement using the {ABC}/2 method in multicenter clinical trials is unknown. We determined the accuracy of {ABC}/2 method as an on-site test in comparison with the gold standard central {HV}-assessment and semiautomatic {HV}-assessment.
Method—We analyzed data from an acute intracerebral hemorrhage multicenter clinical trial. {HV} was measured by site investigators to determine enrollment eligibility ({\textless}60 cm3) using the {ABC}/2 method (on-site {HV}), and independently by the core-imaging laboratory using computer-based analysis (Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization [{MIPAV}] {HV}). {HV} was also measured by {ABC}/2 method (central {HV}) at the core-imaging laboratory to assess the difference in measurements between on-site (multiple raters with variable experiences) and central (single experienced rater) {HVs}.
Results—Fifty-six subjects were analyzed (mean age 62±15 years; 45\% women). On-site {HV} values showed a significantly lower correlation with the {MIPAV} {HV} (r=0.63) than central {HV} and {MIPAV} {HV} (r=0.93) values. The correlation between on-site {HV} and central {HV} values was modest (r=0.51). A total of 73\% of the central {HVs} were within 25\% of the corresponding {MIPAV} {HVs}, whereas only 46\% of the on-site {HVs} were within 25\% of the corresponding {MIPAV} {HVs} (P{\textless}0.001). One protocol violation occurred as a result of inaccuracy of on-site {HV} measurement.
Conclusion—On-site {HV} measurements showed high variability, but the impact on the eligibility determination was small. Centralized remeasurements of {HVs} with feedback to the sites may increase the reliability of the on-site {HV} measurements.

	abstract = {Background
{TMS} (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and {DTT} (diffusion tensor tractography) have different advantages in evaluating stroke patients. {TMS} has good clinical accessibility and economical benefit. On the contrary, {DTT} has a unique advantage to visualize neural tracts three-dimensionally although it requires an expensive and large {MRI} machine. Many studies have demonstrated that {TMS} and {DTT} have predictive values for motor outcome in stroke patients. However, there has been no study on the comparison of these two evaluation tools. In the current study, we compared the abilities of {TMS} and {DTT} to predict upper motor outcome in patients with {ICH} (intracerebral hemorrhage).
Methods
Fifty-three consecutive patients with severe motor weakness were evaluated by {TMS} and {DTT} at the early stage (7–28 days) of {ICH}. Modified Brunnstrom classification ({MBC}) and the motricity index of upper extremity ({UMI}) were evaluated at onset and 6 months after onset.
Results
Patients with the presence of a motor evoked potential ({MEP}) in {TMS} or a preserved corticospinal tract ({CST}) in {DTT} showed better motor outcomes than those without (p = 0.000). {TMS} showed higher positive predictive value than {DTT}. In contrast, {DTT} showed higher negative predictive value than {TMS}.
Conclusions
{TMS} and {DTT} had different advantages in predicting motor outcome, and this result could be a reference to predict final neurological deficit at the early stage of {ICH}.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose The clinical features of thalamic hemorrhage in terms of localization are of great interest in many studies. To better understand the relationship between the localization of thalamic hemorrhage and clinical features, we evaluated the characteristics of patients with four different topographic types of thalamic hemorrhage.
Methods We prospectively studied 100 patients with thalamic hemorrhage who were admitted consecutively to our primary care unit. We divided them into two groups according to large ({\textgreater}2 cm in diameter and/or {\textgreater}4 {mL} in volume) and small thalamic hemorrhage. Four topographic subgroups (large and small) were compared to identify clinical syndromes associated with distinct lesion locations.
Results All patients with posterolateral thalamic hemorrhage had severe sensorimotor deficit. Neuropsychological disturbances in patients with posterolateral thalamic hemorrhage were prominent, with primarily transcortical aphasia in those with left-sided lesions and hemineglect and anosognosia in those with right-sided lesions. Several variants of vertical gaze dysfunction, skew ocular deviation, gaze preference toward the site of the lesion, and miotic pupils were frequent in posterolateral thalamic hemorrhage, particularly in the large type. Patients with small and large anterolateral thalamic hemorrhage were characterized by severe motor and sensory deficits; language and oculomotor disturbances were also observed, although less frequently than in posterolateral hemorrhage. Sensorimotor deficits were observed in patients with medial thalamic hemorrhage (moderate in small hemorrhages and severe in large hemorrhages because of involvement of the adjacent internal capsule). Language disturbances in patients with left-sided lesions and neglect in patients with right-sided lesions were seen only in large medial thalamic hemorrhage. Dorsal thalamic hemorrhage was rare and characterized by mild and transient sensorimotor disturbances. Among patients with dorsal thalamic hemorrhages, only those with large lesions had oculomotor and neuropsychological disturbances.
Conclusions We concluded that despite clinical similarity among the four types of thalamic hemorrhage, there was some discrepancy in the clinical features of small and large thalamic hemorrhages. The most important predictors of death were initial consciousness, nuchal rigidity, maximum size, volume and ventricular extension of hemorrhage, and occurrence of hydrocephalus.},

	abstract = {Purpose The subarachnoid space ({SAS}) lies between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater of the human brain, normally filled with cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}). Subarachnoid hemorrhage ({SAH}) is a serious complication of neurological disease that can have high mortality and high risk of disability. Computed tomography ({CT}) head scans are often used for diagnosing {SAH} which may be difficult when the hemorrhage is small or subtle. A computer-aided diagnosis system from {CT} images is thus developed to augment image interpretation. Methods Supervised learning using the probability of distance features of several landmarks was employed to recognize {SAS}. For each {CT} image, the {SAS} was approximated in four steps: (1) Landmarks including brain boundary, midsagittal plane ({MSP}), anterior and posterior intersection points of brain boundary with the {MSP}, and superior point of the brain were extracted. (2) Distances to all the landmarks were calculated for every pixel in the {CT} image, and combined to construct a high-dimensional feature vector. (3) Using head {CT} images with manually delineated {SAS} as training dataset, the prior probabilities of distances for pixels within {SAS} and non-{SAS} were computed. (4) Any pixel of a head {CT} scan in the testing dataset was classified as an {SAS} or non-{SAS} pixel in a Bayesian decision framework based on its distance features. Results The proposed method was validated on clinical head {CT} images by comparison with manual segmentation. The results showed that the automated method is consistent with the gold standard. Compared with elastic registration based on grayscale information, the proposed method was less affected by grayscale variation between normal controls and patients. Compared with manual delineation, the average spatial overlap, relative overlap, and similarity index were, respectively, 89, 63, and 76\% for the automatic {SAS} approximation of the 69 head {CT} scans tested. The proposed method was tested for {SAH} detection and yielded a sensitivity of 100\% and a specificity of 92\%. Conclusion Automated {SAH} detection with high sensitivity was shown feasible in a prototype computer-aided diagnosis system. The proposed method may be extended for computer-aided diagnosis of several {CSF}-related diseases relevant to {SAS} abnormalities.},

	abstract = {Physicians evaluate computed tomography ({CT}) of the brain to quantitatively and qualitatively identify various types of intracranial hematomas for patients with neurological emergencies. We propose a novel method that can perform this task in a totally automatic fashion, based on a multiresolution binary level set method. The skull regions are segmented in downsized images generated with a maximum filter. The intracranial regions are located using the average gray levels and connectivity. These regions compose the regions of interest ({ROIs}) for segmenting the hematoma from the normal brain. The gray levels of the voxels within these {ROIs} are generated with an averaging filter in a multiresolution fashion. After identifying the candidate hematoma voxels using adaptive thresholds and connectivity, binary level set algorithm is applied repeatedly until the original resolution is reached. We apply our method to non-volumetric non-contrast {CT} images of 15 surgically proven intracranial hematomas and the results were quantitatively evaluated by a human expert. The correlation coefficient between the volumes measured manually and automatically is 0.97. The overlap metrics ranged from 0.97 to 0.74, with an average of 0.88. The average precision and recall are 0.89 and 0.87, respectively. We use decision rules to classify these hematomas and were able to make correct diagnoses in all cases.},

The purpose of this study was to begin to develop automated methods of analysis of {CT} scans to identify putative hypodensity within the lentiform nucleus and insula in patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke.
{METHODS}: Thirty-five {CT} scans were retrospectively selected from our {CT} archive (scans of 20 normal control participants and 15 patients presenting with acute middle cerebral artery stroke symptoms). The {DICOM} data for each participant were interpolated to a single volume, scalp stripped, normalized to a standard atlas, and segmented into anatomic regions. Voxel densities in the lentiform nucleus and insula were compared with the contralateral side at P {\textless} .01 using the Wilcoxon two-sample rank sum statistic, corrected for spatial autocorrelation.
{RESULTS}: The quality of the registration for the anatomic regions was excellent. The control group had two false-positive results. The patient group had two false-negative results in the lentiform nucleus, two false-negative results in the insular cortex, and one false-positive finding for the insular cortex. The remainder of the infarcts were correctly identified. The original clinical reading, performed at the time of presentation, produced five false-negative interpretations for the patient group, all of which were correctly identified by the automated algorithm.
{CONCLUSION}: We present an automated method for identifying potential areas of acute ischemia on {CT} scans. This approach can be extended to other brain regions and vascular territories and may aid in the interpretation of {CT} scans in cases of hyperacute stroke.},

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
The balance of risk and benefit from early neurosurgical intervention for conscious patients with superficial lobar intracerebral haemorrhage of 10–100 {mL} and no intraventricular haemorrhage admitted within 48 h of ictus is unclear. We therefore tested the hypothesis that early surgery compared with initial conservative treatment could improve outcome in these patients.
Methods
In this international, parallel-group trial undertaken in 78 centres in 27 countries, we compared early surgical haematoma evacuation within 12 h of randomisation plus medical treatment with initial medical treatment alone (later evacuation was allowed if judged necessary). An automatic telephone and internet-based randomisation service was used to assign patients to surgery and initial conservative treatment in a 1:1 ratio. The trial was not masked. The primary outcome was a prognosis-based dichotomised (favourable or unfavourable) outcome of the 8 point Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale ({GOSE}) obtained by questionnaires posted to patients at 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number {ISRCTN}22153967.
Findings
307 of 601 patients were randomly assigned to early surgery and 294 to initial conservative treatment; 298 and 291 were followed up at 6 months, respectively; and 297 and 286 were included in the analysis, respectively. 174 (59\%) of 297 patients in the early surgery group had an unfavourable outcome versus 178 (62\%) of 286 patients in the initial conservative treatment group (absolute difference 3·7\% [95\% {CI} −4·3 to 11·6], odds ratio 0·86 [0·62 to 1·20]; p=0·367).
Interpretation
The {STICH} {II} results confirm that early surgery does not increase the rate of death or disability at 6 months and might have a small but clinically relevant survival advantage for patients with spontaneous superficial intracerebral haemorrhage without intraventricular haemorrhage.

	doi = {10.1109/IndianCMIT.2013.6529398},
	abstract = {Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({DWI}) is routinely used for early detection of cerebral ischemic changes in acute stroke. Fast acquisition with a standard echoplanar imaging technique generally compromises the image signal-to-noise ratio and in-plane resolution resulting in a reduction of the conspicuity and definition of lesions in the acquired data when viewed on a standard 8-bit display. We present a novel method for automatically and adaptively determining the window settings that enhance the contrast of the image relative to the ischemic lesions. The method performs a coarse segmentation of the lesions followed by contrast-to-noise ratio based computation of the optimal window parameters. The proposed method was tested on 24 datasets acquired with different protocols. The contrast improvement of the lesions is validated through a mirror region of interest analysis and by using the contrast improvement ratio metric. The average obtained improvement in contrast ranges from 25\% to 60\%. Preliminary results of segmentation showed a good reduction in the false positives and improvement in the lesion boundaries. A perception study of the windowed results against 8 radiologists was conducted. Reduction of 14.17\% in the mean response time of detection was observed. Statistical analysis performed using t-test validates the reduction in mean response time to be significant. Results presented in the study show promise in the method.},

	abstract = {{AbstractBackground}
X-ray computed tomography ({CT}) imaging of the brain is commonly used in diagnostic settings. Although {CT} scans are primarily used in clinical practice, they are increasingly used in research. A fundamental processing step in brain imaging research is brain extraction — the process of separating the brain tissue from all other tissues. Methods for brain extraction have either been 1) validated but not fully automated, or 2) fully automated and informally proposed, but never formally validated.
Aim
To systematically analyze and validate the performance of {FSL}'s brain extraction tool ({BET}) on head {CT} images of patients with intracranial hemorrhage. This was done by comparing the manual gold standard with the results of several versions of automatic brain extraction and by estimating the reliability of automated segmentation of longitudinal scans. The effects of the choice of {BET} parameters and data smoothing is studied and reported.
Methods
All images were thresholded using a 0–100 Hounsfield unit ({HU}) range. In one variant of the pipeline, data were smoothed using a 3-dimensional Gaussian kernel (σ = 1 mm3) and re-thresholded to 0–100 {HU}; in the other, data were not smoothed. {BET} was applied using 1 of 3 fractional intensity ({FI}) thresholds: 0.01, 0.1, or 0.35 and any holes in the brain mask were filled.

For validation against a manual segmentation, 36 images from patients with intracranial hemorrhage were selected from 19 different centers from the {MISTIE} (Minimally Invasive Surgery plus recombinant-tissue plasminogen activator for Intracerebral Evacuation) stroke trial. Intracranial masks of the brain were manually created by one expert {CT} reader. The resulting brain tissue masks were quantitatively compared to the manual segmentations using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the Dice Similarity Index ({DSI}). Brain extraction performance across smoothing and {FI} thresholds was compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The intracranial volume ({ICV}) of each scan was estimated by multiplying the number of voxels in the brain mask by the dimensions of each voxel for that scan. From this, we calculated the {ICV} ratio comparing manual and automated segmentation: I C V automated I C V manual .

To estimate the performance in a large number of scans, brain masks were generated from the 6 {BET} pipelines for 1095 longitudinal scans from 129 patients. Failure rates were estimated from visual inspection. {ICV} of each scan was estimated and an intraclass correlation ({ICC}) was estimated using a one-way {ANOVA}.
Results
Smoothing images improves brain extraction results using {BET} for all measures except specificity (all p \&lt; 0.01, uncorrected), irrespective of the {FI} threshold. Using an {FI} of 0.01 or 0.1 performed better than 0.35. Thus, all reported results refer only to smoothed data using an {FI} of 0.01 or 0.1. Using an {FI} of 0.01 had a higher median sensitivity (0.9901) than an {FI} of 0.1 (0.9884, median difference: 0.0014, p \&lt; 0.001), accuracy (0.9971 vs. 0.9971; median difference: 0.0001, p \&lt; 0.001), and {DSI} (0.9895 vs. 0.9894; median difference: 0.0004, p \&lt; 0.001) and lower specificity (0.9981 vs. 0.9982; median difference: − 0.0001, p \&lt; 0.001). These measures are all very high indicating that a range of {FI} values may produce visually indistinguishable brain extractions. Using smoothed data and an {FI} of 0.01, the mean ({SD}) {ICV} ratio was 1.002 (0.008); the mean being close to 1 indicates the {ICV} estimates are similar for automated and manual segmentation.

In the 1095 longitudinal scans, this pipeline had a low failure rate (5.2\%) and the {ICC} estimate was high (0.929, 95\% {CI}: 0.91, 0.945) for successfully extracted brains.
Conclusion
{BET} performs well at brain extraction on thresholded, 1 mm3 smoothed {CT} images with an {FI} of 0.01 or 0.1. Smoothing before applying {BET} is an important step not previously discussed in the literature. Analysis code is provided.},

{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}
Infarct volume is used as a surrogate outcome measure in clinical trials of therapies for acute ischemic stroke. {ABC}/2 is a fast volumetric method, but its accuracy remains to be determined. We aimed to study the accuracy and reproducibility of {ABC}/2 in determining acute infarct volume with diffusion-weighted imaging.
{METHODS}
We studied 86 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke. Three blinded observers determined volume with the {ABC}/2 method, and the results were compared with those of the manual planimetric method.
{RESULTS}
The {ABC}/2 technique overestimated infarct volume by a median false increase (variable {ABC}/2 volume minus planimetric volume) of 7.33 cm3 (1.29, 22.170, representing a 162.56\% increase over the value of the gold standard (variable {ABC}/2 volume over planimetric volume) (121.70, 248.52). In each method, the interrater reliability was excellent: the intraclass correlations were .992 and .985 for the {ABC}/2 technique and planimetric method, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS}
{ABC}/2 is volumetric method with clinical value but it consistently overestimates the real infarct volume. J Neuroimaging 2012;22:155-159},

	abstract = {Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages ({ICH}) account for 10–30\% of all strokes and are a result of acute bleeding into the brain due to ruptures of small penetrating arteries. Despite major advancements in the management of ischemic strokes and other causes of hemorrhagic strokes, such as ruptured aneurysm, arteriovenous malformations ({AVMs}), or cavernous angioma, during the past several decades, limited progress has been made in the treatment of {ICH}, and the prognosis for patients who suffer them remains poor. The societal impact of these hemorrhagic strokes is magnified by the fact that affected patients typically are a decade younger than those afflicted with ischemic strokes. The {ICH} continues to kill or disable most of their victims. Some studies show that those who suffer {ICH} have a 30-day mortality rate of 35–44\% and a 6-month mortality rate approaching 50\%. Approximately 700,000 new strokes occur in the United States annually and approximately 15\% are hem-orrhagic strokes related to {ICH}. The poor outcome associated with {ICH} is related to the extent of brain damage. {ICH} produces direct destruction and compression of surrounding brain tissue. Direct compression causes poor perfusion and venous drainage to surrounding penumbra at risk, resulting in ischemia to the tissues that most need perfusion [16]. Diagnosis of {ICH} is based largely on clinical history and corroborative Computer Tomography ({CT}) scanning of the brain. The head {CT} scan has a sensitivity and specificity that approach 100\% for acute {ICH}. The hemorrhage volume is the most important predictor of clinical outcome after {ICH} [20]. The volume of {ICH} can be estimated rapidly with a head {CT}. It is an important prognostic indicator and criterion for therapeutic intervention and its expansion can be associated with neurological deterioration. Contrast-enhanced {CT} scan and newer {CT} angiographic ({CTA}) acquisitions can now be performed quickly with the latest-generation scanners. These images can exclude most gross vascular and tumor causes of hemorrhage rapidly and can have an impact on the therapeutic plan [16].},

Though manual segmentation is accurate, it is time consuming and tedious. Semi-automatic methods need user interactions and might introduce variability in results. Our study proposes a modified distance regularized level set evolution ({MDRLSE}) algorithm for hemorrhage segmentation. Methods Study data set (from the ongoing {CLEAR}-{IVH} phase {III} clinical trial) is comprised of 200 sequential {CT} scans of 40 patients collected at 10 different hospitals using different machines/vendors. Data set contained both constant and variable slice thickness scans. Our study included pre-processing (filtering and skull removal), segmentation ({MDRLSE} which is a two-stage method with shrinking and expansion) with modified parameters for faster convergence and higher accuracy and post-processing (reduction in false positives and false negatives). Results Results are validated against the gold standard marked manually by a trained {CT} reader and neurologist. Data sets are grouped as small, medium and large based on the volume of blood. Statistical analysis is performed for both training and test data sets in each group. The median Dice statistical indices ({DSI}) for the 3 groups are 0.8971, 0.8580 and 0.9173 respectively. Pre- and post-processing enhanced the {DSI} by 8 and 4\% respectively. Conclusions The {MDRLSE} improved the accuracy and speed for segmentation and calculation of the hemorrhage volume compared to the original {DRLSE} method. The method generates quantitative information, which is useful for specific decision making and reduces the time needed for the clinicians to localize and segment the hemorrhagic regions.},

We explored the relationship between various parameters of serum glucose concentrations measured during acute hospitalization and hematoma expansion, perihematomal edema, and three month outcome among subjects with {ICH}. Methods A post-hoc analysis of a multicenter prospective study recruiting subjects with {ICH} and elevated systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) ≥170 {mmHg} who presented within 6 h of symptom onset was performed. The serum glucose concentration was measured repeatedly up to 5 times over 3 days after admission and change over time was characterized using a summary statistic by fitting the linear regression model for each subject. The admission glucose, glucose change between admission and 24 hour glucose concentration, and estimated parameters (slope and intercept) were entered in the logistic regression model separately to predict the functional outcome as measured by modified Rankin scale ({mRS}) at 90 days (0–3 vs. 4–6); hematoma expansion at 24 h (≤33 vs. {\textgreater}33\%); and relative perihematomal edema expansion at 24 h (≤40 vs. {\textgreater}40\%). Results A total of 60 subjects were recruited (aged 62.0 ±15.1 years; 56.7\% men). The mean of initial glucose concentration (±standard deviation) was 136.7 mg/dl (±58.1). Thirty-five out of 60 (58\%) subjects had a declining glucose over time (negative slope). The risk of poor outcome ({mRS} 4–6) in those with increasing serum glucose levels was over two-fold relative to those who had declining serum glucose levels ({RR} = 2.64, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 1.03, 6.75). The {RRs} were 2.59 (95\% {CI}: 1.27, 5.30) for hematoma expansion {\textgreater}33\%; and 1.25 (95\% {CI}: 0.73, 2.13) for relative edema expansion {\textgreater}40\%. Conclusions Decline in serum glucose concentration correlated with reduction in proportion of subjects with hematoma expansion and poor clinical outcome. These results provide a justification for a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of aggressive serum glucose reduction in reducing death and disability among patients with {ICH}.},

	abstract = {Over the last 15 years, basic thresholding techniques in combination with standard statistical correlation-based data analysis tools have been widely used to investigate different aspects of evolution of acute or subacute to late stage ischemic stroke in both human and animal data. Yet, a wave of biology-dependent and imaging-dependent issues is still untackled pointing towards the key question: “how does an ischemic stroke evolve?” Paving the way for potential answers to this question, both magnetic resonance ({MRI}) and {CT} (computed tomography) images have been used to visualize the lesion extent, either with or without spatial distinction between dead and salvageable tissue. Combining diffusion and perfusion imaging modalities may provide the possibility of predicting further tissue recovery or eventual necrosis. Going beyond these basic thresholding techniques, in this critical appraisal, we explore different semi-automatic or fully automatic 2D/3D medical image analysis methods and mathematical models applied to human, animal (rats/rodents) and/or synthetic ischemic stroke to tackle one of the following three problems: (1) segmentation of infarcted and/or salvageable (also called penumbral) tissue, (2) prediction of final ischemic tissue fate (death or recovery) and (3) dynamic simulation of the lesion core and/or penumbra evolution. To highlight the key features in the reviewed segmentation and prediction methods, we propose a common categorization pattern. We also emphasize some key aspects of the methods such as the imaging modalities required to build and test the presented approach, the number of patients/animals or synthetic samples, the use of external user interaction and the methods of assessment (clinical or imaging-based). Furthermore, we investigate how any key difficulties, posed by the evolution of stroke such as swelling or reperfusion, were detected (or not) by each method. In the absence of any imaging-based macroscopic dynamic model applied to ischemic stroke, we have insights into relevant microscopic dynamic models simulating the evolution of brain ischemia in the hope to further promising and challenging 4D imaging-based dynamic models. By depicting the major pitfalls and the advanced aspects of the different reviewed methods, we present an overall critique of their performances and concluded our discussion by suggesting some recommendations for future research work focusing on one or more of the three addressed problems.},

	abstract = {Background The purpose of this study was to define the incidence, imaging characteristics, natural history, and prognostic implication of corticospinal tract Wallerian degeneration ({CST}‐{WD}) in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) using serial {MR} imaging.
Methods and Results Consecutive {ICH} patients with supratentorial {ICH} prospectively underwent serial {MRIs} at 2, 7, 14, and 21 days. {MRIs} were analyzed by independent raters for the presence and topographical distribution of {CST}‐{WD} on diffusion‐weighted imaging ({DWI}). Baseline demographics, hematoma characteristics, {ICH} score, and admission National Institute of Health Stroke Score ({NIHSS}) were systematically recorded. Functional outcome at 3 months was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale ({mRS}) and the motor‐{NIHSS}. Twenty‐seven patients underwent 93 {MRIs}; 88 of these were serially obtained in the first month. In 13 patients (48\%), all with deep {ICH}, {CST}‐{WD} changes were observed after a median of 7 days (interquartile range, 7 to 8) as reduced diffusion on {DWI} and progressed rostrocaudally along the {CST}. {CST}‐{WD} changes evolved into T2‐hyperintense areas after a median of 11 days (interquartile range, 6 to 14) and became atrophic on {MRIs} obtained after 3 months. In univariate analyses, the presence of {CST}‐{WD} was associated with poor functional outcome (ie, {mRS} 4 to 6; P=0.046) and worse motor‐{NIHSS} (5 versus 1, P=0.001) at 3 months.
Conclusions Wallerian degeneration along the {CST} is common in spontaneous supratentorial {ICH}, particularly in deep {ICH}. It can be detected 1 week after {ICH} on {DWI} and progresses rostrocaudally along the {CST} over time. The presence of {CST}‐{WD} is associated with poor motor and functional recovery after {ICH}.},

We hypothesize that hematoma volume measurement on {QSM} is independent of imaging parameters, eliminating its echo time dependence on gradient echo {MRI}.
Methods—Gradient echo {MRI} of 16 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage was processed with susceptibility-weighted imaging, R2* (=1/T2*) mapping, and {QSM} at various echo times. Hematoma volumes were measured from these images.
Results—Linear regression of hematoma volume versus echo time showed substantial slopes for gradient echo magnitude (0.45±0.31 L/s), susceptibility-weighted imaging (0.52±0.46), and R2* (0.39±0.30) but nearly zero slope for {QSM} (0.01±0.05). At echo time=20 ms, hematoma volume on {QSM} was 0.80× that on gradient echo magnitude image (R2=0.99).
Conclusions—{QSM} can provide reliable measurement of hematoma volume, which can be performed rapidly and accurately using a semiautomated segmentation tool.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: Dynamic perfusion {CT} ({PCT}) with deconvolution produces maps of time-to-peak ({TTP}), mean transit time ({MTT}), regional cerebral blood flow ({rCBF}), and regional cerebral blood volume ({rCBV}), with a computerized automated map of the infarct and penumbra. We determined the accuracy of these maps in patients with suspected acute hemispheric stroke.
{METHODS}: Forty-six patients underwent nonenhanced {CT} and dynamic {PCT}, with follow-up {CT} or {MR} imaging. Two observers reviewed the nonenhanced studies for signs of stroke and read the {PCT} maps for {TTP}, {MTT}, {rCBF}, and {rCBV} abnormalities. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and interobserver agreement were compared (Wilcoxon tests). Nonenhanced {CT} and {PCT} data were reviewed for stroke extent according to previously reported methods. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the computerized maps in detecting ischemia and its extent were determined.
{RESULTS}: Compared with nonenhanced {CT}, {PCT} maps were significantly more accurate in detecting stroke (75.7–86.0\% vs. 66.2\%; P {\textless} .01), {MTT} maps were significantly more sensitive (77.6\% vs. 69.2\%; P {\textless} .01), and {rCBF} and {rCBV} maps were significantly more specific (90.9\% and 92.7\%, respectively, vs. 65.0\%; P {\textless} .01). Regarding stroke extent, {PCT} maps were significantly more sensitive than nonenhanced {CT} (up to 94.4\% vs. 42.9\%; P {\textless} .01) and had higher interobserver agreement (up to 0.763). For the computerized map, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, respectively, were 68.2\%, 92.3\%, and 88.1\% in detecting ischemia and 72.2\%, 91.8\%, and 87.9\% in showing the extent.
{CONCLUSION}: Dynamic {PCT} maps are more accurate than nonenhanced {CT} in detecting hemispheric strokes. Despite limited spatial coverage, {PCT} is highly reliable to assess the stroke extent.},

	abstract = {Wallerian degeneration of the corticospinal tract ({CST}) after motor pathway ischemic stroke can be characterized by diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}). However, the dynamic evolution of the diffusion indices in the degenerated {CST} has not previously been completely identified. We investigated this dynamic evolution and the relationship between early changes of the diffusion indices in the degenerated {CST} and long-term clinical outcomes. {DTI} and neurological examinations were performed repeatedly in 9 patients with first-onset motor pathway subcortical infarction at 5 consecutive time points, i.e. within 1 week, at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months and 1 year. Using a region of interest method, we analyzed the ratios of the fractional anisotropy ({rFA}), mean diffusivity ({rMD}), primary eigenvalue (rλ1) and transverse eigenvalue (rλ23) between the affected and unaffected sides of the {CSTs}. We did not find any significant changes in the diffusion indices of the contralesional {CSTs} across time points. The {rFA} decreased monotonously during the first 3 months and then stabilized. The {rMD} increased after 2 weeks and stabilized after the third month. The rλ1 decreased during the first 2 weeks and then remained unchanged. The rλ23 increased during the first 3 months and then stabilized. We also found that the changes in the {rFA} between the first 2 time points were correlated with the {NIHSS} (P = 0.00003) and the Motricity Indices (P = 0.0004) after 1 year. Our results suggest that for patients with motor pathway stroke the diffusion indices in the degenerated {CST} stabilize within 3 months and that early changes in the {rFA} of the {CST} may predict long-term clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose—The {ABC}/2 score estimates intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) volume, yet validations have been limited by small samples and inappropriate outcome measures. We determined accuracy of the {ABC}/2 score calculated at a specialized reading center ({RC}-{ABC}) or local site (site-{ABC}) versus the reference-standard computed tomography–based planimetry ({CTP}).
Methods—In Minimally Invasive Surgery Plus Recombinant Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Evacuation-{II} ({MISTIE}-{II}), Clot Lysis Evaluation of Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage ({CLEAR}-{IVH}) and {CLEAR}-{III} trials. {ICH} volume was prospectively calculated by {CTP}, {RC}-{ABC}, and site-{ABC}. Agreement between {CTP} and {ABC}/2 was defined as an absolute difference up to 5 {mL} and relative difference within 20\%. Determinants of {ABC}/2 accuracy were assessed by logistic regression.
Results—In 4369 scans from 507 patients, {CTP} was more strongly correlated with {RC}-{ABC} (r2=0.93) than with site-{ABC} (r2=0.87). Although {RC}-{ABC} overestimated {CTP}-based volume on average ({RC}-{ABC}, 15.2 cm3; {CTP}, 12.7 cm3), agreement was reasonable when categorized into mild, moderate, and severe {ICH} (κ=0.75; P{\textless}0.001). This was consistent with overestimation of {ICH} volume in 6 of 8 previous studies. Agreement with {CTP} was greater for {RC}-{ABC} (84\% within 5 {mL}; 48\% of scans within 20\%) than for site-{ABC} (81\% within 5 {mL}; 41\% within 20\%). {RC}-{ABC} had moderate accuracy for detecting ≥5 {mL} change in {CTP} volume between consecutive scans (sensitivity, 0.76; specificity, 0.86) and was more accurate with smaller {ICH}, thalamic hemorrhage, and homogeneous clots.
Conclusions—{ABC}/2 scores at local or central sites are sufficiently accurate to categorize {ICH} volume and assess eligibility for the {CLEAR}-{III} and {MISTIE} {III} studies and moderately accurate for change in {ICH} volume. However, accuracy decreases with large, irregular, or lobar clots.

	abstract = {The United States National Institutes of Health ({NIH}) commit significant support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools ({ANTs}), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The {ANTs} open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use {ANTs} to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the {ANTs} implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted {MRI} brain image data of 40 subjects ({UCLA}'s {LPBA}40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best {ANTs} methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard = 0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard = 0.669 ± 0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

	abstract = {Objective: To determine potential predictors of good outcome in primary medium to large intracerebral haemorrhages ({ICH}) which could be useful for selecting patients for surgical procedures.
Methods: Subjects were 138 patients with spontaneous hemispheric {ICH} {\textgreater}20 ml. They were non-surgically treated and were admitted consecutively to 15 hospitals within the first 12 hours of symptom onset (mean ({SD}), 5.8 (3.1) hours). Haematoma volume was measured on computed tomography ({CT}) at admission. Stroke severity was assessed by the Canadian stroke scale ({CSS}). Good outcome was defined as modified Rankin score ⩽2 at three months.
Results: At the end of the follow up period, 45 patients (32.6\%) had good outcome. Baseline stroke severity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and acute phase reaction biochemical markers ({ESR}, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, neutrophil count) were significantly associated with good outcome in bivariate analyses. Of the initial {CT} scan variables, intraventricular contamination, deep location, mass effect, and greater {ICH} volume were related to poor outcome. On multiple logistic regression analysis, cortical location of bleeding (odds ratio 3.79 (95\% confidence interval 1.2 to 12.01); p = 0.023), high {CSS} score ({OR} 2.3 (1.6 to 3.1); p{\textless}0.0001), and low fibrinogen concentrations ({OR} 0.92 (0.87 to 0.97); p = 0.001) were independent predictors of good outcome. These three factors correctly classified 85\% of patients.
Conclusions: Good outcome in medium to large {ICH} can be predicted on admission by three readily assessable factors ({CSS} score, {ICH} location, and fibrinogen levels). These predictors may be helpful in selecting patients for surgical treatment.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose— Intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) is the most fatal and disabling stroke subtype. Widely used tools for prediction of mortality are fundamentally limited in that they do not account for effects of withdrawal of care and are not designed to predict functional recovery. We developed an acute clinical score to predict likelihood of functional independence.
Methods— We prospectively characterized 629 consecutive patients with {ICH} at hospital presentation. Predictors of functional independence (Glasgow Outcome Score ≥4) at 90 days were used to develop a logistic regression-based risk stratification scale in a random subset of two thirds and validated in the remaining one third of the cohort.
Results— At 90 days, 162 (26\%) patients achieved independence. Age, Glasgow Coma Scale, {ICH} location, volume (all P{\textless}0.0001), and pre-{ICH} cognitive impairment (P=0.005) were independently associated with Glasgow Outcome Score ≥4. The {FUNC} score was developed as a sum of individual points (0–11) based on strength of association with outcome. In both the development and validation cohorts, the proportion of patients who achieved Glasgow Outcome Score ≥4 increased steadily with {FUNC} score. No patient assigned a {FUNC} score ≤4 achieved functional independence, whereas {\textgreater}80\% with a score of 11 did. The predictive accuracy of the {FUNC} score remained unchanged when restricted to {ICH} survivors only, consistent with absence of confounding by early withdrawal of care.
Conclusions— {FUNC} score is a valid clinical assessment tool that identifies patients with {ICH} who will attain functional independence and thus, can provide guidance in clinical decision-making and patient selection for clinical trials.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

We therefore develop practical generalized additive model fitting methods for large data sets in the case in which the smooth terms in the model are represented by using penalized regression splines. The methods use iterative update schemes to obtain factors of the model matrix while requiring only subblocks of the model matrix to be computed at any one time. We show that efficient smoothing parameter estimation can be carried out in a well-justified manner. The grid load prediction problem requires updates of the model fit, as new data become available, and some means for dealing with residual auto-correlation in grid load. Methods are provided for these problems and parallel implementation is covered. The methods allow estimation of generalized additive models for large data sets by using modest computer hardware, and the grid load prediction problem illustrates the utility of reduced rank spline smoothing methods for dealing with complex modelling problems.},

The present analyses aimed to determine the effects of treatment on hematoma and perihematomal edema over 72 hours.
Methods{INTERACT} included 404 patients with {CT}-confirmed intracerebral hemorrhage, elevated systolic {BP} (150 to 220 mm Hg), and capacity to start {BP}-lowering treatment within 6 hours of intracerebral hemorrhage. Patients were randomly assigned to an intensive (target systolic {BP} 140 {mmHg}) or standard guideline-based management of {BP} (target systolic {BP} 180 mm Hg) using routine intravenous agents. Baseline and repeat {CTs} (24 and 72 hours) were performed using standardized techniques with digital images analyzed centrally. Outcomes were increases in hematoma and perihematomal edema volumes over 72 hours.
Results-Overall, 296 patients had all 3 {CT} scans available for the hematoma and 270 for the edema analyses. Mean systolic {BP} was 11.7 mm Hg lower in the intensive group than in the guideline group during 1 to 24 hours. Adjusted mean absolute increases in hematoma volumes ({mL}) at 24 and 72 hours were 2.40 and 0.15 in the guideline group compared with -0.74 and -2.31 in the intensive group, respectively, an overall difference of 2.80 (95\% {CI}, 1.04 to 4.56; P=0.002). Adjusted mean absolute increases in edema volumes ({mL}) at 24 and 72 hours were 6.27 and 10.02 in the guideline group compared with 4.19 and 7.34 in the intensive group, respectively, for an overall difference of 2.38 (95\% {CI}, -0.45 to 5.22; P=0.10).
Conclusion-Early intensive {BP}-lowering treatment attenuated hematoma growth over 72 hours in intracerebral hemorrhage. There were no appreciable effects on perihematomal edema.},

Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia ({FTD}) and Alzheimer's disease ({AD}), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method ({SyN}) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast {SyN}'s performance with a related elastic method and with the standard {ITK} implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of {FTD} and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, {SyN}'s volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that {SyN}, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric {MRI} of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

This algorithm, geodesic normalization, provides solutions that are invariant to which of the input coordinate systems (images) is chosen as a reference. This allows the method to compute metric distances, have truly symmetric performance and to give full space-time solutions that are invertible and diffeomorphic in the discrete domain. Finally, our algorithm guarantees that our solutions and their inverses are consistent to a sub-pixel level.},

	abstract = {Computed tomographic ({CT}) images are widely used in the diagnosis of stroke. In this paper, we present an automated method to detect and classify an abnormality into acute infarct, chronic infarct and hemorrhage at the slice level of non-contrast {CT} images. The proposed method consists of three main steps: image enhancement, detection of mid-line symmetry and classification of abnormal slices. A windowing operation is performed on the intensity distribution to enhance the region of interest. Domain knowledge about the anatomical structure of the skull and the brain is used to detect abnormalities in a rotation- and translation-invariant manner. A two-level classification scheme is used to detect abnormalities using features derived in the intensity and the wavelet domain. The proposed method has been evaluated on a dataset of 15 patients (347 image slices). The method gives 90\% accuracy and 100\% recall in detecting abnormality at patient level; and achieves an average precision of 91\% and recall of 90\% at the slice level.},

In the following step, the segmentation of {CT} images having {ICH} is performed using a new hybrid method for automatic segmentation. The proposed method has hierarchical structure and is based on unsupervised fuzzy clustering and expert system-based labeling. The hierarchical structure has two levels: the global and the local. The segmented images are interpolated and a quantitative analysis is performed in the final step of the procedure. The quantitative analysis includes the volume measurement of the {ICH} and the edema regions. The system has been used on a number of {CT} head scans and performed correct quantitative analysis},

	abstract = {Computed tomographic ({CT}) images are widely used for the identification of abnormal brain tissue following infarct and hemorrhage in stroke. Manual lesion delineation is currently the standard approach, but is both time-consuming and operator-dependent. To address these issues, we present a method that can automatically delineate infarct and hemorrhage in stroke {CT} images. The key elements of this method are the accurate normalization of {CT} images from stroke patients into template space and the subsequent voxelwise comparison with a group of control {CT} images for defining areas with hypo- or hyper-intense signals. Our validation, using simulated and actual lesions, shows that our approach is effective in reconstructing lesions resulting from both infarct and hemorrhage and yields lesion maps spatially consistent with those produced manually by expert operators. A limitation is that, relative to manual delineation, there is reduced sensitivity of the automated method in regions close to the ventricles and the brain contours. However, the automated method presents a number of benefits in terms of offering significant time savings and the elimination of the inter-operator differences inherent to manual tracing approaches. These factors are relevant for the creation of large-scale lesion databases for neuropsychological research. The automated delineation of stroke lesions from {CT} scans may also enable longitudinal studies to quantify changes in damaged tissue in an objective and reproducible manner.},

Methods: Thirty-day case fatality was stratified by age, sex, and calendar year after {ICH} and {SAH} using logistic regression. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to estimate the risk of death during the first year of follow-up and survivors at 1 year.
Results: Case fatality after {ICH} was 42.0\%, compared with 28.7\% after {SAH}. It increased with age ({ICH}: 29.7\% for 20-49 years, 54.6\% for 80-89 years; {SAH}: 20.3\% for 20-49 years, 56.7\% for 80-89 years; both p-trend {\textless} 0.001), and decreased over the period 2000-2001 to 2006-2008 ({ICH}: from 53.1\% to 35.8\%, p-trend {\textless} 0.001; {SAH}: from 33.3\% to 24.7\%, p-trend = 0.02). Risk of death was significantly higher among stroke patients during the first year of follow-up compared with controls ({ICH}: hazard ratio [{HR}] 2.60, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 2.09-3.24, p {\textless} 0.01; {SAH}: {HR} 2.87, 95\% {CI} 2.07-3.97, p {\textless} 0.01) and remained elevated among survivors at 1 year ({ICH}: {HR} 2.02, 95\% {CI} 1.75-2.32, p {\textless} 0.01; {SAH}: {HR} 1.32, 95\% {CI} 1.02-1.69, p = 0.03).
Conclusions: More than one-third of individuals die in the first month after hemorrhagic stroke, and patients younger than 50 years are more likely to die after {ICH} than {SAH}. Short-term case fatality has decreased over time. Patients who survive hemorrhagic stroke have a continuing elevated risk of death compared with matched individuals from the general population.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose-The reliability of hematoma volume ({HV}) measurement using the {ABC}/2 method in multicenter clinical trials is unknown. We determined the accuracy of {ABC}/2 method as an on-site test in comparison with the gold standard central {HV}-assessment and semiautomatic {HV}-assessment.
Method-We analyzed data from an acute intracerebral hemorrhage multicenter clinical trial. {HV} was measured by site investigators to determine enrollment eligibility ({\textless}60 cm3) using the {ABC}/2 method (on-site {HV}), and independently by the core-imaging laboratory using computer-based analysis (Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization [{MIPAV}] {HV}). {HV} was also measured by {ABC}/2 method (central {HV}) at the core-imaging laboratory to assess the difference in measurements between on-site (multiple raters with variable experiences) and central (single experienced rater) {HVs}.
Results-Fifty-six subjects were analyzed (mean age 62±15 years; 45\% women). On-site {HV} values showed a significantly lower correlation with the {MIPAV} {HV} (r=0.63) than central {HV} and {MIPAV} {HV} (r=0.93) values. The correlation between on-site {HV} and central {HV} values was modest (r=0.51). A total of 73\% of the central {HVs} were within 25\% of the corresponding {MIPAV} {HVs}, whereas only 46\% of the on-site {HVs} were within 25\% of the corresponding {MIPAV} {HVs} (P{\textless}0.001). One protocol violation occurred as a result of inaccuracy of on-site {HV} measurement.
Conclusion-On-site {HV} measurements showed high variability, but the impact on the eligibility determination was small. Centralized remeasurements of {HVs} with feedback to the sites may increase the reliability of the on-site {HV} measurements.

	abstract = {Background
{TMS} (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and {DTT} (diffusion tensor tractography) have different advantages in evaluating stroke patients. {TMS} has good clinical accessibility and economical benefit. On the contrary, {DTT} has a unique advantage to visualize neural tracts three-dimensionally although it requires an expensive and large {MRI} machine. Many studies have demonstrated that {TMS} and {DTT} have predictive values for motor outcome in stroke patients. However, there has been no study on the comparison of these two evaluation tools. In the current study, we compared the abilities of {TMS} and {DTT} to predict upper motor outcome in patients with {ICH} (intracerebral hemorrhage).
Methods
Fifty-three consecutive patients with severe motor weakness were evaluated by {TMS} and {DTT} at the early stage (7-28 days) of {ICH}. Modified Brunnstrom classification ({MBC}) and the motricity index of upper extremity ({UMI}) were evaluated at onset and 6 months after onset.
Results
Patients with the presence of a motor evoked potential ({MEP}) in {TMS} or a preserved corticospinal tract ({CST}) in {DTT} showed better motor outcomes than those without (p = 0.000). {TMS} showed higher positive predictive value than {DTT}. In contrast, {DTT} showed higher negative predictive value than {TMS}.
Conclusions
{TMS} and {DTT} had different advantages in predicting motor outcome, and this result could be a reference to predict final neurological deficit at the early stage of {ICH}.},

Methods The formula {ABC}/2 was used, where A is the greatest hemorrhage diameter by {CT}, B is the diameter 90° to A, and C is the approximate number of {CT} slices with hemorrhage multiplied by the slice thickness.
Results The {ICH} volumes for 118 patients were evaluated in a mean of 38 seconds and correlated with planimetric measurements (R2=.96). Interrater and intrarater reliability were excellent, with an intraclass correlation of .99 for both.
Conclusions We conclude that {ICH} volume can be accurately estimated in less than 1 minute with the simple formula {ABC}/2.},

	abstract = {Purpose The subarachnoid space ({SAS}) lies between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater of the human brain, normally filled with cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}). Subarachnoid hemorrhage ({SAH}) is a serious complication of neurological disease that can have high mortality and high risk of disability. Computed tomography ({CT}) head scans are often used for diagnosing {SAH} which may be difficult when the hemorrhage is small or subtle. A computer-aided diagnosis system from {CT} images is thus developed to augment image interpretation. Methods Supervised learning using the probability of distance features of several landmarks was employed to recognize {SAS}. For each {CT} image, the {SAS} was approximated in four steps: (1) Landmarks including brain boundary, midsagittal plane ({MSP}), anterior and posterior intersection points of brain boundary with the {MSP}, and superior point of the brain were extracted. (2) Distances to all the landmarks were calculated for every pixel in the {CT} image, and combined to construct a high-dimensional feature vector. (3) Using head {CT} images with manually delineated {SAS} as training dataset, the prior probabilities of distances for pixels within {SAS} and non-{SAS} were computed. (4) Any pixel of a head {CT} scan in the testing dataset was classified as an {SAS} or non-{SAS} pixel in a Bayesian decision framework based on its distance features. Results The proposed method was validated on clinical head {CT} images by comparison with manual segmentation. The results showed that the automated method is consistent with the gold standard. Compared with elastic registration based on grayscale information, the proposed method was less affected by grayscale variation between normal controls and patients. Compared with manual delineation, the average spatial overlap, relative overlap, and similarity index were, respectively, 89, 63, and 76\% for the automatic {SAS} approximation of the 69 head {CT} scans tested. The proposed method was tested for {SAH} detection and yielded a sensitivity of 100\% and a specificity of 92\%. Conclusion Automated {SAH} detection with high sensitivity was shown feasible in a prototype computer-aided diagnosis system. The proposed method may be extended for computer-aided diagnosis of several {CSF}-related diseases relevant to {SAS} abnormalities.},

	abstract = {Physicians evaluate computed tomography ({CT}) of the brain to quantitatively and qualitatively identify various types of intracranial hematomas for patients with neurological emergencies. We propose a novel method that can perform this task in a totally automatic fashion, based on a multiresolution binary level set method. The skull regions are segmented in downsized images generated with a maximum filter. The intracranial regions are located using the average gray levels and connectivity. These regions compose the regions of interest ({ROIs}) for segmenting the hematoma from the normal brain. The gray levels of the voxels within these {ROIs} are generated with an averaging filter in a multiresolution fashion. After identifying the candidate hematoma voxels using adaptive thresholds and connectivity, binary level set algorithm is applied repeatedly until the original resolution is reached. We apply our method to non-volumetric non-contrast {CT} images of 15 surgically proven intracranial hematomas and the results were quantitatively evaluated by a human expert. The correlation coefficient between the volumes measured manually and automatically is 0.97. The overlap metrics ranged from 0.97 to 0.74, with an average of 0.88. The average precision and recall are 0.89 and 0.87, respectively. We use decision rules to classify these hematomas and were able to make correct diagnoses in all cases.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: The quantitative nature of {CT} should make it amenable to semiautomated analysis using modern neuroimaging methods. The purpose of this study was to begin to develop automated methods of analysis of {CT} scans to identify putative hypodensity within the lentiform nucleus and insula in patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke.
{METHODS}: Thirty-five {CT} scans were retrospectively selected from our {CT} archive (scans of 20 normal control participants and 15 patients presenting with acute middle cerebral artery stroke symptoms). The {DICOM} data for each participant were interpolated to a single volume, scalp stripped, normalized to a standard atlas, and segmented into anatomic regions. Voxel densities in the lentiform nucleus and insula were compared with the contralateral side at P {\textless} .01 using the Wilcoxon two-sample rank sum statistic, corrected for spatial autocorrelation.
{RESULTS}: The quality of the registration for the anatomic regions was excellent. The control group had two false-positive results. The patient group had two false-negative results in the lentiform nucleus, two false-negative results in the insular cortex, and one false-positive finding for the insular cortex. The remainder of the infarcts were correctly identified. The original clinical reading, performed at the time of presentation, produced five false-negative interpretations for the patient group, all of which were correctly identified by the automated algorithm.
{CONCLUSION}: We present an automated method for identifying potential areas of acute ischemia on {CT} scans. This approach can be extended to other brain regions and vascular territories and may aid in the interpretation of {CT} scans in cases of hyperacute stroke.},

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
The balance of risk and benefit from early neurosurgical intervention for conscious patients with superficial lobar intracerebral haemorrhage of 10-100 {mL} and no intraventricular haemorrhage admitted within 48 h of ictus is unclear. We therefore tested the hypothesis that early surgery compared with initial conservative treatment could improve outcome in these patients.
Methods
In this international, parallel-group trial undertaken in 78 centres in 27 countries, we compared early surgical haematoma evacuation within 12 h of randomisation plus medical treatment with initial medical treatment alone (later evacuation was allowed if judged necessary). An automatic telephone and internet-based randomisation service was used to assign patients to surgery and initial conservative treatment in a 1:1 ratio. The trial was not masked. The primary outcome was a prognosis-based dichotomised (favourable or unfavourable) outcome of the 8 point Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale ({GOSE}) obtained by questionnaires posted to patients at 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number {ISRCTN}22153967.
Findings
307 of 601 patients were randomly assigned to early surgery and 294 to initial conservative treatment; 298 and 291 were followed up at 6 months, respectively; and 297 and 286 were included in the analysis, respectively. 174 (59\%) of 297 patients in the early surgery group had an unfavourable outcome versus 178 (62\%) of 286 patients in the initial conservative treatment group (absolute difference 3·7\% [95\% {CI} -4·3 to 11·6], odds ratio 0·86 [0·62 to 1·20]; p=0·367).
Interpretation
The {STICH} {II} results confirm that early surgery does not increase the rate of death or disability at 6 months and might have a small but clinically relevant survival advantage for patients with spontaneous superficial intracerebral haemorrhage without intraventricular haemorrhage.

	abstract = {Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({DWI}) is routinely used for early detection of cerebral ischemic changes in acute stroke. Fast acquisition with a standard echoplanar imaging technique generally compromises the image signal-to-noise ratio and in-plane resolution resulting in a reduction of the conspicuity and definition of lesions in the acquired data when viewed on a standard 8-bit display. We present a novel method for automatically and adaptively determining the window settings that enhance the contrast of the image relative to the ischemic lesions. The method performs a coarse segmentation of the lesions followed by contrast-to-noise ratio based computation of the optimal window parameters. The proposed method was tested on 24 datasets acquired with different protocols. The contrast improvement of the lesions is validated through a mirror region of interest analysis and by using the contrast improvement ratio metric. The average obtained improvement in contrast ranges from 25\% to 60\%. Preliminary results of segmentation showed a good reduction in the false positives and improvement in the lesion boundaries. A perception study of the windowed results against 8 radiologists was conducted. Reduction of 14.17\% in the mean response time of detection was observed. Statistical analysis performed using t-test validates the reduction in mean response time to be significant. Results presented in the study show promise in the method.},

	abstract = {{AbstractBackground}
X-ray computed tomography ({CT}) imaging of the brain is commonly used in diagnostic settings. Although {CT} scans are primarily used in clinical practice, they are increasingly used in research. A fundamental processing step in brain imaging research is brain extraction - the process of separating the brain tissue from all other tissues. Methods for brain extraction have either been 1) validated but not fully automated, or 2) fully automated and informally proposed, but never formally validated.
Aim
To systematically analyze and validate the performance of {FSL}'s brain extraction tool ({BET}) on head {CT} images of patients with intracranial hemorrhage. This was done by comparing the manual gold standard with the results of several versions of automatic brain extraction and by estimating the reliability of automated segmentation of longitudinal scans. The effects of the choice of {BET} parameters and data smoothing is studied and reported.
Methods
All images were thresholded using a 0-100 Hounsfield unit ({HU}) range. In one variant of the pipeline, data were smoothed using a 3-dimensional Gaussian kernel (σ = 1 mm3) and re-thresholded to 0-100 {HU}; in the other, data were not smoothed. {BET} was applied using 1 of 3 fractional intensity ({FI}) thresholds: 0.01, 0.1, or 0.35 and any holes in the brain mask were filled.

For validation against a manual segmentation, 36 images from patients with intracranial hemorrhage were selected from 19 different centers from the {MISTIE} (Minimally Invasive Surgery plus recombinant-tissue plasminogen activator for Intracerebral Evacuation) stroke trial. Intracranial masks of the brain were manually created by one expert {CT} reader. The resulting brain tissue masks were quantitatively compared to the manual segmentations using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the Dice Similarity Index ({DSI}). Brain extraction performance across smoothing and {FI} thresholds was compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The intracranial volume ({ICV}) of each scan was estimated by multiplying the number of voxels in the brain mask by the dimensions of each voxel for that scan. From this, we calculated the {ICV} ratio comparing manual and automated segmentation: I C V automated I C V manual .

To estimate the performance in a large number of scans, brain masks were generated from the 6 {BET} pipelines for 1095 longitudinal scans from 129 patients. Failure rates were estimated from visual inspection. {ICV} of each scan was estimated and an intraclass correlation ({ICC}) was estimated using a one-way {ANOVA}.
Results
Smoothing images improves brain extraction results using {BET} for all measures except specificity (all p < 0.01, uncorrected), irrespective of the {FI} threshold. Using an {FI} of 0.01 or 0.1 performed better than 0.35. Thus, all reported results refer only to smoothed data using an {FI} of 0.01 or 0.1. Using an {FI} of 0.01 had a higher median sensitivity (0.9901) than an {FI} of 0.1 (0.9884, median difference: 0.0014, p < 0.001), accuracy (0.9971 vs. 0.9971; median difference: 0.0001, p < 0.001), and {DSI} (0.9895 vs. 0.9894; median difference: 0.0004, p < 0.001) and lower specificity (0.9981 vs. 0.9982; median difference: - 0.0001, p < 0.001). These measures are all very high indicating that a range of {FI} values may produce visually indistinguishable brain extractions. Using smoothed data and an {FI} of 0.01, the mean ({SD}) {ICV} ratio was 1.002 (0.008); the mean being close to 1 indicates the {ICV} estimates are similar for automated and manual segmentation.

In the 1095 longitudinal scans, this pipeline had a low failure rate (5.2\%) and the {ICC} estimate was high (0.929, 95\% {CI}: 0.91, 0.945) for successfully extracted brains.
Conclusion
{BET} performs well at brain extraction on thresholded, 1 mm3 smoothed {CT} images with an {FI} of 0.01 or 0.1. Smoothing before applying {BET} is an important step not previously discussed in the literature. Analysis code is provided.},

{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}
Infarct volume is used as a surrogate outcome measure in clinical trials of therapies for acute ischemic stroke. {ABC}/2 is a fast volumetric method, but its accuracy remains to be determined. We aimed to study the accuracy and reproducibility of {ABC}/2 in determining acute infarct volume with diffusion-weighted imaging.
{METHODS}
We studied 86 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke. Three blinded observers determined volume with the {ABC}/2 method, and the results were compared with those of the manual planimetric method.
{RESULTS}
The {ABC}/2 technique overestimated infarct volume by a median false increase (variable {ABC}/2 volume minus planimetric volume) of 7.33 cm3 (1.29, 22.170, representing a 162.56\% increase over the value of the gold standard (variable {ABC}/2 volume over planimetric volume) (121.70, 248.52). In each method, the interrater reliability was excellent: the intraclass correlations were .992 and .985 for the {ABC}/2 technique and planimetric method, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS}
{ABC}/2 is volumetric method with clinical value but it consistently overestimates the real infarct volume. J Neuroimaging 2012;22:155-159},

	abstract = {Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages ({ICH}) account for 10-30\% of all strokes and are a result of acute bleeding into the brain due to ruptures of small penetrating arteries. Despite major advancements in the management of ischemic strokes and other causes of hemorrhagic strokes, such as ruptured aneurysm, arteriovenous malformations ({AVMs}), or cavernous angioma, during the past several decades, limited progress has been made in the treatment of {ICH}, and the prognosis for patients who suffer them remains poor. The societal impact of these hemorrhagic strokes is magnified by the fact that affected patients typically are a decade younger than those afflicted with ischemic strokes. The {ICH} continues to kill or disable most of their victims. Some studies show that those who suffer {ICH} have a 30-day mortality rate of 35-44\% and a 6-month mortality rate approaching 50\%. Approximately 700,000 new strokes occur in the United States annually and approximately 15\% are hem-orrhagic strokes related to {ICH}. The poor outcome associated with {ICH} is related to the extent of brain damage. {ICH} produces direct destruction and compression of surrounding brain tissue. Direct compression causes poor perfusion and venous drainage to surrounding penumbra at risk, resulting in ischemia to the tissues that most need perfusion [16]. Diagnosis of {ICH} is based largely on clinical history and corroborative Computer Tomography ({CT}) scanning of the brain. The head {CT} scan has a sensitivity and specificity that approach 100\% for acute {ICH}. The hemorrhage volume is the most important predictor of clinical outcome after {ICH} [20]. The volume of {ICH} can be estimated rapidly with a head {CT}. It is an important prognostic indicator and criterion for therapeutic intervention and its expansion can be associated with neurological deterioration. Contrast-enhanced {CT} scan and newer {CT} angiographic ({CTA}) acquisitions can now be performed quickly with the latest-generation scanners. These images can exclude most gross vascular and tumor causes of hemorrhage rapidly and can have an impact on the therapeutic plan [16].},

Though manual segmentation is accurate, it is time consuming and tedious. Semi-automatic methods need user interactions and might introduce variability in results. Our study proposes a modified distance regularized level set evolution ({MDRLSE}) algorithm for hemorrhage segmentation. Methods Study data set (from the ongoing {CLEAR}-{IVH} phase {III} clinical trial) is comprised of 200 sequential {CT} scans of 40 patients collected at 10 different hospitals using different machines/vendors. Data set contained both constant and variable slice thickness scans. Our study included pre-processing (filtering and skull removal), segmentation ({MDRLSE} which is a two-stage method with shrinking and expansion) with modified parameters for faster convergence and higher accuracy and post-processing (reduction in false positives and false negatives). Results Results are validated against the gold standard marked manually by a trained {CT} reader and neurologist. Data sets are grouped as small, medium and large based on the volume of blood. Statistical analysis is performed for both training and test data sets in each group. The median Dice statistical indices ({DSI}) for the 3 groups are 0.8971, 0.8580 and 0.9173 respectively. Pre- and post-processing enhanced the {DSI} by 8 and 4\% respectively. Conclusions The {MDRLSE} improved the accuracy and speed for segmentation and calculation of the hemorrhage volume compared to the original {DRLSE} method. The method generates quantitative information, which is useful for specific decision making and reduces the time needed for the clinicians to localize and segment the hemorrhagic regions.},

We explored the relationship between various parameters of serum glucose concentrations measured during acute hospitalization and hematoma expansion, perihematomal edema, and three month outcome among subjects with {ICH}. Methods A post-hoc analysis of a multicenter prospective study recruiting subjects with {ICH} and elevated systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) ≥170 {mmHg} who presented within 6 h of symptom onset was performed. The serum glucose concentration was measured repeatedly up to 5 times over 3 days after admission and change over time was characterized using a summary statistic by fitting the linear regression model for each subject. The admission glucose, glucose change between admission and 24 hour glucose concentration, and estimated parameters (slope and intercept) were entered in the logistic regression model separately to predict the functional outcome as measured by modified Rankin scale ({mRS}) at 90 days (0-3 vs. 4-6); hematoma expansion at 24 h (≤33 vs. {\textgreater}33\%); and relative perihematomal edema expansion at 24 h (≤40 vs. {\textgreater}40\%). Results A total of 60 subjects were recruited (aged 62.0 ±15.1 years; 56.7\% men). The mean of initial glucose concentration (±standard deviation) was 136.7 mg/dl (±58.1). Thirty-five out of 60 (58\%) subjects had a declining glucose over time (negative slope). The risk of poor outcome ({mRS} 4-6) in those with increasing serum glucose levels was over two-fold relative to those who had declining serum glucose levels ({RR} = 2.64, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 1.03, 6.75). The {RRs} were 2.59 (95\% {CI}: 1.27, 5.30) for hematoma expansion {\textgreater}33\%; and 1.25 (95\% {CI}: 0.73, 2.13) for relative edema expansion {\textgreater}40\%. Conclusions Decline in serum glucose concentration correlated with reduction in proportion of subjects with hematoma expansion and poor clinical outcome. These results provide a justification for a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of aggressive serum glucose reduction in reducing death and disability among patients with {ICH}.},

	abstract = {Over the last 15 years, basic thresholding techniques in combination with standard statistical correlation-based data analysis tools have been widely used to investigate different aspects of evolution of acute or subacute to late stage ischemic stroke in both human and animal data. Yet, a wave of biology-dependent and imaging-dependent issues is still untackled pointing towards the key question: “how does an ischemic stroke evolve?” Paving the way for potential answers to this question, both magnetic resonance ({MRI}) and {CT} (computed tomography) images have been used to visualize the lesion extent, either with or without spatial distinction between dead and salvageable tissue. Combining diffusion and perfusion imaging modalities may provide the possibility of predicting further tissue recovery or eventual necrosis. Going beyond these basic thresholding techniques, in this critical appraisal, we explore different semi-automatic or fully automatic 2D/3D medical image analysis methods and mathematical models applied to human, animal (rats/rodents) and/or synthetic ischemic stroke to tackle one of the following three problems: (1) segmentation of infarcted and/or salvageable (also called penumbral) tissue, (2) prediction of final ischemic tissue fate (death or recovery) and (3) dynamic simulation of the lesion core and/or penumbra evolution. To highlight the key features in the reviewed segmentation and prediction methods, we propose a common categorization pattern. We also emphasize some key aspects of the methods such as the imaging modalities required to build and test the presented approach, the number of patients/animals or synthetic samples, the use of external user interaction and the methods of assessment (clinical or imaging-based). Furthermore, we investigate how any key difficulties, posed by the evolution of stroke such as swelling or reperfusion, were detected (or not) by each method. In the absence of any imaging-based macroscopic dynamic model applied to ischemic stroke, we have insights into relevant microscopic dynamic models simulating the evolution of brain ischemia in the hope to further promising and challenging 4D imaging-based dynamic models. By depicting the major pitfalls and the advanced aspects of the different reviewed methods, we present an overall critique of their performances and concluded our discussion by suggesting some recommendations for future research work focusing on one or more of the three addressed problems.},

	abstract = {Background The purpose of this study was to define the incidence, imaging characteristics, natural history, and prognostic implication of corticospinal tract Wallerian degeneration ({CST}‐{WD}) in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) using serial {MR} imaging.
Methods and Results Consecutive {ICH} patients with supratentorial {ICH} prospectively underwent serial {MRIs} at 2, 7, 14, and 21 days. {MRIs} were analyzed by independent raters for the presence and topographical distribution of {CST}‐{WD} on diffusion‐weighted imaging ({DWI}). Baseline demographics, hematoma characteristics, {ICH} score, and admission National Institute of Health Stroke Score ({NIHSS}) were systematically recorded. Functional outcome at 3 months was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale ({mRS}) and the motor‐{NIHSS}. Twenty‐seven patients underwent 93 {MRIs}; 88 of these were serially obtained in the first month. In 13 patients (48\%), all with deep {ICH}, {CST}‐{WD} changes were observed after a median of 7 days (interquartile range, 7 to 8) as reduced diffusion on {DWI} and progressed rostrocaudally along the {CST}. {CST}‐{WD} changes evolved into T2‐hyperintense areas after a median of 11 days (interquartile range, 6 to 14) and became atrophic on {MRIs} obtained after 3 months. In univariate analyses, the presence of {CST}‐{WD} was associated with poor functional outcome (ie, {mRS} 4 to 6; P=0.046) and worse motor‐{NIHSS} (5 versus 1, P=0.001) at 3 months.
Conclusions Wallerian degeneration along the {CST} is common in spontaneous supratentorial {ICH}, particularly in deep {ICH}. It can be detected 1 week after {ICH} on {DWI} and progresses rostrocaudally along the {CST} over time. The presence of {CST}‐{WD} is associated with poor motor and functional recovery after {ICH}.},

Methods-Gradient echo {MRI} of 16 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage was processed with susceptibility-weighted imaging, R2* (=1/T2*) mapping, and {QSM} at various echo times. Hematoma volumes were measured from these images.
Results-Linear regression of hematoma volume versus echo time showed substantial slopes for gradient echo magnitude (0.45±0.31 L/s), susceptibility-weighted imaging (0.52±0.46), and R2* (0.39±0.30) but nearly zero slope for {QSM} (0.01±0.05). At echo time=20 ms, hematoma volume on {QSM} was 0.80× that on gradient echo magnitude image (R2=0.99).
Conclusions-{QSM} can provide reliable measurement of hematoma volume, which can be performed rapidly and accurately using a semiautomated segmentation tool.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}: Dynamic perfusion {CT} ({PCT}) with deconvolution produces maps of time-to-peak ({TTP}), mean transit time ({MTT}), regional cerebral blood flow ({rCBF}), and regional cerebral blood volume ({rCBV}), with a computerized automated map of the infarct and penumbra. We determined the accuracy of these maps in patients with suspected acute hemispheric stroke.
{METHODS}: Forty-six patients underwent nonenhanced {CT} and dynamic {PCT}, with follow-up {CT} or {MR} imaging. Two observers reviewed the nonenhanced studies for signs of stroke and read the {PCT} maps for {TTP}, {MTT}, {rCBF}, and {rCBV} abnormalities. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and interobserver agreement were compared (Wilcoxon tests). Nonenhanced {CT} and {PCT} data were reviewed for stroke extent according to previously reported methods. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the computerized maps in detecting ischemia and its extent were determined.
{RESULTS}: Compared with nonenhanced {CT}, {PCT} maps were significantly more accurate in detecting stroke (75.7-86.0\% vs. 66.2\%; P {\textless} .01), {MTT} maps were significantly more sensitive (77.6\% vs. 69.2\%; P {\textless} .01), and {rCBF} and {rCBV} maps were significantly more specific (90.9\% and 92.7\%, respectively, vs. 65.0\%; P {\textless} .01). Regarding stroke extent, {PCT} maps were significantly more sensitive than nonenhanced {CT} (up to 94.4\% vs. 42.9\%; P {\textless} .01) and had higher interobserver agreement (up to 0.763). For the computerized map, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, respectively, were 68.2\%, 92.3\%, and 88.1\% in detecting ischemia and 72.2\%, 91.8\%, and 87.9\% in showing the extent.
{CONCLUSION}: Dynamic {PCT} maps are more accurate than nonenhanced {CT} in detecting hemispheric strokes. Despite limited spatial coverage, {PCT} is highly reliable to assess the stroke extent.},

	abstract = {Wallerian degeneration of the corticospinal tract ({CST}) after motor pathway ischemic stroke can be characterized by diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}). However, the dynamic evolution of the diffusion indices in the degenerated {CST} has not previously been completely identified. We investigated this dynamic evolution and the relationship between early changes of the diffusion indices in the degenerated {CST} and long-term clinical outcomes. {DTI} and neurological examinations were performed repeatedly in 9 patients with first-onset motor pathway subcortical infarction at 5 consecutive time points, i.e. within 1 week, at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months and 1 year. Using a region of interest method, we analyzed the ratios of the fractional anisotropy ({rFA}), mean diffusivity ({rMD}), primary eigenvalue (rλ1) and transverse eigenvalue (rλ23) between the affected and unaffected sides of the {CSTs}. We did not find any significant changes in the diffusion indices of the contralesional {CSTs} across time points. The {rFA} decreased monotonously during the first 3 months and then stabilized. The {rMD} increased after 2 weeks and stabilized after the third month. The rλ1 decreased during the first 2 weeks and then remained unchanged. The rλ23 increased during the first 3 months and then stabilized. We also found that the changes in the {rFA} between the first 2 time points were correlated with the {NIHSS} (P = 0.00003) and the Motricity Indices (P = 0.0004) after 1 year. Our results suggest that for patients with motor pathway stroke the diffusion indices in the degenerated {CST} stabilize within 3 months and that early changes in the {rFA} of the {CST} may predict long-term clinical outcomes.},

We determined accuracy of the {ABC}/2 score calculated at a specialized reading center ({RC}-{ABC}) or local site (site-{ABC}) versus the reference-standard computed tomography-based planimetry ({CTP}).
Methods-In Minimally Invasive Surgery Plus Recombinant Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Evacuation-{II} ({MISTIE}-{II}), Clot Lysis Evaluation of Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage ({CLEAR}-{IVH}) and {CLEAR}-{III} trials. {ICH} volume was prospectively calculated by {CTP}, {RC}-{ABC}, and site-{ABC}. Agreement between {CTP} and {ABC}/2 was defined as an absolute difference up to 5 {mL} and relative difference within 20\%. Determinants of {ABC}/2 accuracy were assessed by logistic regression.
Results-In 4369 scans from 507 patients, {CTP} was more strongly correlated with {RC}-{ABC} (r2=0.93) than with site-{ABC} (r2=0.87). Although {RC}-{ABC} overestimated {CTP}-based volume on average ({RC}-{ABC}, 15.2 cm3; {CTP}, 12.7 cm3), agreement was reasonable when categorized into mild, moderate, and severe {ICH} (κ=0.75; P{\textless}0.001). This was consistent with overestimation of {ICH} volume in 6 of 8 previous studies. Agreement with {CTP} was greater for {RC}-{ABC} (84\% within 5 {mL}; 48\% of scans within 20\%) than for site-{ABC} (81\% within 5 {mL}; 41\% within 20\%). {RC}-{ABC} had moderate accuracy for detecting ≥5 {mL} change in {CTP} volume between consecutive scans (sensitivity, 0.76; specificity, 0.86) and was more accurate with smaller {ICH}, thalamic hemorrhage, and homogeneous clots.
Conclusions-{ABC}/2 scores at local or central sites are sufficiently accurate to categorize {ICH} volume and assess eligibility for the {CLEAR}-{III} and {MISTIE} {III} studies and moderately accurate for change in {ICH} volume. However, accuracy decreases with large, irregular, or lobar clots.

	abstract = {The United States National Institutes of Health ({NIH}) commit significant support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools ({ANTs}), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The {ANTs} open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use {ANTs} to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the {ANTs} implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted {MRI} brain image data of 40 subjects ({UCLA}'s {LPBA}40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best {ANTs} methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard = 0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard = 0.669 ± 0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

	abstract = {Objective: To determine potential predictors of good outcome in primary medium to large intracerebral haemorrhages ({ICH}) which could be useful for selecting patients for surgical procedures.
Methods: Subjects were 138 patients with spontaneous hemispheric {ICH} {\textgreater}20 ml. They were non-surgically treated and were admitted consecutively to 15 hospitals within the first 12 hours of symptom onset (mean ({SD}), 5.8 (3.1) hours). Haematoma volume was measured on computed tomography ({CT}) at admission. Stroke severity was assessed by the Canadian stroke scale ({CSS}). Good outcome was defined as modified Rankin score ⩽2 at three months.
Results: At the end of the follow up period, 45 patients (32.6\%) had good outcome. Baseline stroke severity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and acute phase reaction biochemical markers ({ESR}, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, neutrophil count) were significantly associated with good outcome in bivariate analyses. Of the initial {CT} scan variables, intraventricular contamination, deep location, mass effect, and greater {ICH} volume were related to poor outcome. On multiple logistic regression analysis, cortical location of bleeding (odds ratio 3.79 (95\% confidence interval 1.2 to 12.01); p = 0.023), high {CSS} score ({OR} 2.3 (1.6 to 3.1); p{\textless}0.0001), and low fibrinogen concentrations ({OR} 0.92 (0.87 to 0.97); p = 0.001) were independent predictors of good outcome. These three factors correctly classified 85\% of patients.
Conclusions: Good outcome in medium to large {ICH} can be predicted on admission by three readily assessable factors ({CSS} score, {ICH} location, and fibrinogen levels). These predictors may be helpful in selecting patients for surgical treatment.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose- Intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) is the most fatal and disabling stroke subtype. Widely used tools for prediction of mortality are fundamentally limited in that they do not account for effects of withdrawal of care and are not designed to predict functional recovery. We developed an acute clinical score to predict likelihood of functional independence.
Methods- We prospectively characterized 629 consecutive patients with {ICH} at hospital presentation. Predictors of functional independence (Glasgow Outcome Score ≥4) at 90 days were used to develop a logistic regression-based risk stratification scale in a random subset of two thirds and validated in the remaining one third of the cohort.
Results- At 90 days, 162 (26\%) patients achieved independence. Age, Glasgow Coma Scale, {ICH} location, volume (all P{\textless}0.0001), and pre-{ICH} cognitive impairment (P=0.005) were independently associated with Glasgow Outcome Score ≥4. The {FUNC} score was developed as a sum of individual points (0-11) based on strength of association with outcome. In both the development and validation cohorts, the proportion of patients who achieved Glasgow Outcome Score ≥4 increased steadily with {FUNC} score. No patient assigned a {FUNC} score ≤4 achieved functional independence, whereas {\textgreater}80\% with a score of 11 did. The predictive accuracy of the {FUNC} score remained unchanged when restricted to {ICH} survivors only, consistent with absence of confounding by early withdrawal of care.
Conclusions- {FUNC} score is a valid clinical assessment tool that identifies patients with {ICH} who will attain functional independence and thus, can provide guidance in clinical decision-making and patient selection for clinical trials.},

	abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

We therefore develop practical generalized additive model fitting methods for large data sets in the case in which the smooth terms in the model are represented by using penalized regression splines. The methods use iterative update schemes to obtain factors of the model matrix while requiring only subblocks of the model matrix to be computed at any one time. We show that efficient smoothing parameter estimation can be carried out in a well-justified manner. The grid load prediction problem requires updates of the model fit, as new data become available, and some means for dealing with residual auto-correlation in grid load. Methods are provided for these problems and parallel implementation is covered. The methods allow estimation of generalized additive models for large data sets by using modest computer hardware, and the grid load prediction problem illustrates the utility of reduced rank spline smoothing methods for dealing with complex modelling problems.},

Safety stopping rules based on neurologic deterioration and serious adverse events were prespecified and approved by an {NIH}-appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board, which provided oversight on subject safety. Each subject was followed-up for 3 months to preliminarily assess mortality and the clinical outcomes. A total of 18, 20, and 22 patients were enrolled in the respective three tiers of systolic blood pressure treatment goals. Overall, 9 of 60 patients had treatment failures (all in the last tier). A total of seven subjects with neurologic deterioration were observed: one (6\%), two (10\%), and four (18\%) in tier one, two, and three, respectively. Serious adverse events were observed in one subject (5\%) in tier two and in three subjects (14\%) in tier three. However, the safety stopping rule was not activated in any of the tiers. Three (17\%), two (10\%), and five (23\%) subjects in tiers one, two, and three, respectively, died within 3 months., Conclusions: The observed proportions of neurologic deterioration and serious adverse events were below the prespecified safety thresholds, and the 3-month mortality rate was lower than expected in all systolic blood pressure tiers. The results form the basis of a larger randomized trial addressing the efficacy of systolic blood pressure reduction in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage., (C) 2010 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose- Although data on some risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) already are beyond doubt, for other factors, the evidence is less clear. We performed a systematic overview of case-control and cohort studies on risk factors for {ICH}.
Methods- We searched {MEDLINE}, {LILACS}, {EXTRAMED}, and Pascal from 1966 to 2001 to identify studies. Studies were included if they met predefined methodological criteria. When possible, 2×2 tables were extracted and combined with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Summary odds ratios ({ORs}) were calculated for case-control studies, and summary relative risks ({RRs}) were found for cohort studies and for case-control and cohort studies combined.
Results— Fourteen case-control and 11 cohort studies were identified. We could not always combine the results of case-control and cohort studies. In cohort studies, the crude {RR} for age (every 10-year increase) was 1.97 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.79 to 2.16). In case-control studies, the crude {OR} for high alcohol intake was 3.36 (95\% {CI}, 2.21 to 5.12) and for hypertension was 3.68 (95\% {CI}, 2.52 to 5.38). Two cohort studies showed an increasing risk of {ICH} with increasing degree of hypertension. In cohort and case-control studies combined, the crude {RR} for sex (male versus female) was 3.73 (95\% {CI}, 3.28 to 4.25); for current smoking, 1.31 (95\% {CI}, 1.09 to 1.58); and for diabetes, 1.30 (95\% {CI}, 1.02 to 1.67).
Conclusions- Risk factors for {ICH} appeared to be age, male sex, hypertension, and high alcohol intake. High cholesterol tends to be associated with a lower risk of {ICH}. We could not assess whether these risk factors are independent.},

We reviewed the medical records and computed tomographic films for all cases of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in Greater Cincinnati during 1988. Independent predictors of 30-day mortality were determined using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses.
The 30-day mortality for the 188 cases of intracerebral hemorrhage was 44\%, with half of deaths occurring within the first 2 days of onset. Volume of intracerebral hemorrhage was the strongest predictor of 30-day mortality for all locations of intracerebral hemorrhage. Using three categories of parenchymal hemorrhage volume (0 to 29 cm3, 30 to 60 cm3, and 61 cm3 or more), calculated by a quick and easy-to-use ellipsoid method, and two categories of the Glasgow Coma Scale (9 or more and 8 or less), 30-day mortality was predicted correctly with a sensitivity of 96\% and a specificity of 98\%. Patients with a parenchymal hemorrhage volume of 60 cm3 or more on their initial computed tomogram and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or less had a predicted 30-day mortality of 91\%. Patients with a volume of less than 30 cm3 and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 9 or more had a predicted 30-day mortality of 19\%. Only one of the 71 patients with a volume of parenchymal hemorrhage of 30 cm3 or more could function independently at 30 days.
Volume of intracerebral hemorrhage, in combination with the initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, is a powerful and easy-to-use predictor of 30-day mortality and morbidity in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.},

Test-retest reliability did not differ significantly among a neurologist, a neurology house officer, a neurology nurse, or an emergency department nurse. The stroke scale validity was assessed by comparing the scale scores obtained prospectively on 65 acute stroke patients to the patients' infarction size as measured by computed tomography scan at 1 week and to the patients' clinical outcome as determined at 3 months. These correlations (scale-lesion size r = 0.68, scale-outcome r = 0.79) suggested acceptable examination and scale validity. Of the 15 test items, the most interrater reliable item (pupillary response) had low validity. Less reliable items such as upper or lower extremity motor function were more valid.

	shorttitle = {Stroke Incidence, Prevalence, and Survival},
	abstract = {Background and Purpose: Trends in stroke incidence and mortality are available from few sites worldwide. The unique nature of the medical care in patients from Rochester, Minn, has allowed the ascertainment of virtually all cases of stroke for community residents for the period dating from 1955. This study updates incidence rates, stroke mortality, radiological imaging availability, and prevalence for stroke and subtypes of stroke though 1989 and evaluates trends since 1955., Methods: Medical records of all residents of Rochester with potential diagnosis of stroke during the 5-year period through December 31, 1989, were screened to determine whether the case met the criteria for stroke. The type of stroke was determined with the use of all available data. Average annual age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates for stroke and various types of stroke were calculated for 5-year periods from 1955 to 1989. Prevalence of stroke was also determined. Poisson regression was used to better clarify the dependence of stroke incidence on multiple variables. Cox proportional hazards modeling evaluated trends in short-term and long-term stroke survival., Results: We found that 496 incidence cases of stroke occurred among Rochester residents during 1985 to 1989. The annual age- and sex-adjusted stroke incidence rate was 145 per 100 000 population, which was virtually unchanged from 1980 to 1984 and 13\% higher than the rate determined in 1975 to 1979. Increasing incidence rates compared with the 1970s were noted in all groups aged older than 54 years and in both sexes. Survival after cerebral infarction was dependent on age and calendar year when trends dating from 1955 were evaluated. The annual incidence rate of intraparenchymal hemorrhage was twice that of subarachnoid hemorrhage., Conclusions: Incidence rates for stroke have remained at a higher rate than those determined in the 1970s. Although the occurrence of untreated hypertension has been reported to be stable or decreasing, the incidence rate of stroke is higher than those noted during the decline in stroke incidence during the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to the impact of radiological imaging, increased contribution of patients with ischemic heart disease, and the possible detection of milder cases of stroke, other factors, which are undefined, may be contributing to the increased stroke incidence rates detected over the last 10 years., (Stroke. 1996;27:373-380.), (C) 1996 American Heart Association, Inc.},

In this paper, we present an automated method to detect and classify an abnormality into acute infarct, chronic infarct and hemorrhage at the slice level of non-contrast {CT} images. The proposed method consists of three main steps: image enhancement, detection of mid-line symmetry and classification of abnormal slices. A windowing operation is performed on the intensity distribution to enhance the region of interest. Domain knowledge about the anatomical structure of the skull and the brain is used to detect abnormalities in a rotation- and translation-invariant manner. A two-level classification scheme is used to detect abnormalities using features derived in the intensity and the wavelet domain. The proposed method has been evaluated on a dataset of 15 patients (347 image slices). The method gives 90\% accuracy and 100\% recall in detecting abnormality at patient level; and achieves an average precision of 91\% and recall of 90\% at the slice level.},

	abstract = {Mutual information ({MI})-based image registration has been found to be quite effective in many medical imaging applications. To determine the {MI} between two images, the joint histogram of the two images is required. In the literature, linear interpolation and partial volume interpolation ({PVI}) are often used while estimating the joint histogram for registration purposes. It has been shown that joint histogram estimation through these two interpolation methods may introduce artifacts in the {MI} registration function that hamper the optimization process and influence the registration accuracy. In this paper, we present a new joint histogram estimation scheme called generalized partial volume estimation ({GPVE}). It turns out that the {PVI} method is a special case of the {GPVE} procedure. We have implemented our algorithm on the clinically obtained brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance image data furnished by Vanderbilt University. Our experimental results show that, by properly choosing the kernel functions, the {GPVE} algorithm significantly reduces the interpolation-induced artifacts and, in cases that the artifacts clearly affect registration accuracy, the registration accuracy is improved.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose- A simple clinical scale of intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}), comprising the Glasgow Coma Scale score, age, infratentorial origin, {ICH} volume, and intraventricular hemorrhage, was recently shown to predict 30-day mortality. We studied how well the original {ICH} Score would predict morbidity and mortality and determined whether modification would improve the predictions.
Methods- Patients admitted to a regional hospital with acute {ICH} in 1999 were reviewed. Independent predictors of mortality or good outcome (modified Rankin score ≤2) at 30 days were identified by logistic regression to devise a new {ICH} Score for comparison with the original Score. A modified Score was created by substituting National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ({NIHSS}) for the Glasgow Coma Scale.
Results- The mortality rate was 22\%, and 35\% had good outcome. Independent factors for mortality were high {NIHSS} score, intraventricular hemorrhage, subarachnoid extension, and narrow pulse pressure. Independent factors for good outcome were low {NIHSS} score and low admission temperature. For all {ICH} Scores, no patient had a maximum score of 6. Cutoff values of ≥3 and {\textless}3 provided the best Youden's index of diagnostic test in all {ICH} Scores for mortality and good outcome, respectively. The original and modified {ICH} Scores predict mortality equally well. The new and modified {ICH} Scores are slightly better for prediction of good outcome.
Conclusions- All 3 {ICH} Scores are simple clinical grading scales. As reliable predictors of good outcome and/or mortality, they are useful in clinical research studies and standardization of clinical protocols.},

This approach produces a consistent set of transformations that have less pairwise registration error, i.e., better correspondence, than traditional methods that estimate the forward and reverse transformations independently. The transformations are estimated iteratively and are restricted to preserve topology by constraining them to obey the laws of continuum mechanics. The transformations are parameterized by a Fourier series to diagonalize the covariance structure imposed by the continuum mechanics constraints and to provide a computationally efficient numerical implementation. Results using a linear elastic material constraint are presented using both magnetic resonance and X-ray computed tomography image data. The results show that the joint estimation of a consistent set of forward and reverse transformations constrained by linear-elasticity give better registration results than using either constraint alone or none at all.},

Design Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify independent risk factors and to construct a grading scale for predicting the outcome of {ICH}.
Setting The Taichung Veterans General Hospital in Taichung, Taiwan.
Participants Two hundred and ninety-three patients were diagnosed with spontaneous {ICH} between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2007.
Intervention Development of the simplified {ICH} score ({sICH} score) for predicting the 30-day mortality of {ICH}.
Main Outcome Measures The discrimination of the prediction model was determined by measuring the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ({AUC}).
Results The accuracy of the {sICH} score was 80.5\%, the sensitivity was 82.5\% and the specificity was 80.2\%. The {AUCs} are as follows: {sICH} score, 0.89 (0.84-0.94); {ICH} score, 0.74 (0.65-0.83) and {ICH}-{GS}, 0.74 (0.65-0.83).
Conclusions The {sICH} score showed best discrimination among tested models. Also, it was easier for physicians without special training in neurology or radiology to use this scale. With statistical power and ease of use, the {sICH} score is a very suitable model for risk stratification of spontaneous {ICH}.},

	abstract = {Explicit segmentation is required for many forms of quantitative neuroanatomic analysis. However, manual methods are time-consuming and subject to errors in both accuracy and reproducibility (precision). A 3-D model-based segmentation method is presented in this paper for the completely automatic identification and delineation of gross anatomical structures of the human brain based on their appearance in magnetic resonance images ({MRI}). The approach depends on a general, iterative, hierarchical non-linear registration procedure and a 3-D digital model of human brain anatomy that contains both volumetric intensity-based data and a geometric atlas. Here, the traditional segmentation strategy is inverted: instead of matching geometric contours from and idealized atlas directly to the {MRI} data, segmentation is achieved by identifying the non-linear spatial transformation that best maps corresponding intensity-based features between a model image and a new {MRI} brain volume. When completed, atlas contours defined on the model image are mapped through the same transformation to segment and label individual structures in the new data set. Using manually segmented sturcture boundaries for comparison, measures of volumetric difference and volumetric overlap were less than 2\% and better than 97\% for realistic brain phantom data, and less than 10\% and better than 85\%, respectively, for human {MRI} data. This compares favorably to intra-observer variability estimates of 4.9\% and 87\%, respectively. The procedure performs well, is objective and its implementation robust. The procedure requires no manual intervention, and is thus applicable to studies of large numbers of subjects. The general method for non-linear image matching is also useful for non-linear mapping of brain data sets into stereotaxic space if the target volume is already in stereotaxic space. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Correlation-based similarity metric should be maximal when two images are perfectly aligned. Since similarity metric is a non-convex function and contains many local optima, choice of search strategy for optimization is important in registration problem. Many optimization schemes are existing, most of which are local and require a starting point. In present study we have implemented genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization technique to overcome this problem.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the presence of hydrocephalus after {ICH} would predict mortality and functional outcome.
Methods-Patients with spontaneous supratentorial {ICH} were identified in our prospectively collected database to determine the following: age, sex, race, past medical history; Glasgow Coma Scale ({GCS}) score and blood pressure on admission; use of mechanical ventilation, mannitol, and ventriculostomy; and medical complications. {CT} scans performed within 24 hours of hemorrhage were retrospectively analyzed to determine lesion size and location, pineal shift, cisternal effacement, intraventricular hemorrhage ({IVH}), and hydrocephalus. Outcome was determined with use of hospital disposition (dead, nursing home, rehabilitation, home) and functional outcome (Functional Independence Measure [{FIM}]) at 3 months. Patients with and without hydrocephalus were compared and univariate and multivariate analyses performed to determine whether hydrocephalus was an independent predictor of mortality. Data are presented as mean±{SD}.
Results-Of the 81 patients studied, 40 had hydrocephalus. Those with hydrocephalus were younger (57±15 versus 67±15 years), had lower {GCS} scores (8.2±4.2 versus 11±2.9), were more likely to have ganglionic or thalamic hemorrhages, and were intubated more frequently (70\% versus 27\%). Hospital mortality was higher in patients with hydrocephalus (51\% versus 2\%), and fewer patients went home (21\% versus 35\%). Those who died had higher hydrocephalus scores (9.67±7.1 versus 5.75±4.5). Outcome was no different if a ventriculostomy was placed. The final logistic regression model included hydrocephalus score, gender, {GCS}, and pineal shift, and it correctly predicted 85\% of patients as dead or alive. Multivariate analyses indicated that hydrocephalus is an independent predictor of mortality.
Conclusions-We conclude that hydrocephalus is an independent predictor of mortality after {ICH}.},

	abstract = {The Oxford {FMRIb} Software Library ({FSL}) Brain Extraction Tool ({BET}) is a widely used algorithm for removing extracranial tissues from {MR} images. Although {BET} is effective and simple to operate, it often fails to exclude fully all non-brain tissues unless the centre of gravity of the brain is specified to the programme. In this communication we present a recursive procedure for using {BET} that is extremely robust for extracting brain images without any manual intervention. The approach was tested on 150 adult head volumes and produced accurate results in all cases. The approach is efficient and suitable for incorporation into automated workflows and other pipeline methods.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose. Controlling for intracranial volume is crucial in magnetic resonance studies of changes in brain volumes. However, full intracranial volume measurement requires prolonged scanning and analysis, and simple, validated methods for intracranial volume estimation are lacking. The authors developed and evaluated a method of estimating intracranial volume using a single mid-sagittal slice, the intracranial cross-sectional area. Methods. Forty men aged 65-70 had whole skull magnetic resonance scans at 1.9 T, with slice thickness of 1.5 mm (no interslice gap). Intracranial cross-sectional area was traced in the midline sagittal slice of the 3-view localizer. Intracranial volume was measured using every slice. Ten intracranial cross-sectional area measurements were tested for interrater reliability. Results. Intracranial cross-sectional area and intracranial volume correlated highly (r= .88, P {\textless} .0001). A modified Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between intracranial cross-sectional area and intracranial volume. The intraclass correlation (an indicator of reliability) for intracranial cross-sectional area was r= .976 (P {\textless} .005). Conclusions. The rapid and simple technique of intracranial cross-sectional area measurement provides a valid and reliable estimate of intracranial volume.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose- 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ({HMG}-{CoA}) reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been associated with improved outcome after ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage but an increased risk of incident intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}). We investigated (1) whether statin use before {ICH} was associated with functional independence at 90 days, and (2) whether survivors exposed to statins after {ICH} had an increased risk of recurrence.
Methods- We analyzed 629 consecutive {ICH} patients with 90-day outcome data enrolled in a prospective cohort study between 1998 to 2005. Statin use was determined by patient interview at the time of {ICH} and supplemented by medical record review. Independent status was defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale 4 or 5. {ICH} survivors were followed by telephone interview every 6 months.
Results- Statins were used by 149/629 (24\%) before {ICH}. There was no effect of pre-{ICH} statin use on the rates of functional independence (28\% versus 29\%, P=0.84) or mortality (46\% versus 45\%, P=0.93). Medical comorbidities and warfarin use were more common in statin users. Hematoma volumes were similar (median 28 cm3 in pre-{ICH} statin users compared to 22 cm3 in nonusers, P=0.18). The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for independent status in pre-{ICH} statin users was 1.16 (95\% {CI} 0.65 to 2.10, P=0.62). {ICH} survivors treated with statins after discharge did not have a higher risk of recurrence (adjusted {HR} 0.82, 95\% {CI} 0.34 to 1.99, P=0.66).
Conclusions- Pre-{ICH} statin use is not associated with improved {ICH} functional outcome or mortality. Post-{ICH} statin use is not associated with an increased risk of {ICH} recurrence.},

	volume = {17},
	issn = {0278-0062},
	doi = {10.1109/42.730402},
	abstract = {In a previous study (J.B. West et al., J. Comput. Assist. Tomogr., vol. 21, p. 554-66, 1997) the authors demonstrated that automatic retrospective registration algorithms can frequently register magnetic resonance ({MR}) and computed tomography ({CT}) images of the brain with an accuracy of better than 2 mm, but in that same study the authors found that such algorithms sometimes fail, leading to errors of 6 mm or more. Before these algorithms can be used routinely in the clinic, methods must be provided for distinguishing between registration solutions that are clinically satisfactory and those that are not. One approach is to rely on a human observer to inspect the registration results and reject images that have been registered with insufficient accuracy. In this paper, the authors present a methodology for evaluating the efficacy of the visual assessment of registration accuracy. Since the clinical requirements for level of registration accuracy are likely to be application dependent, the authors have evaluated the accuracy of the observer's estimate relative to 6 thresholds: 1-6 mm. The performance of the observers was evaluated relative to the registration solution obtained using external fiducial markers that are screwed into the patient's skull and that are visible in both {MR} and {CT} images. This fiducial marker system provides the gold standard for the authors' study. Its accuracy is shown to be approximately 0.5 mm. Two experienced, blinded observers viewed 5 pairs of clinical {MR} and {CT} brain images, each of which had each been misregistered with respect to the gold standard solution. Fourteen misregistrations were assessed for each image pair with misregistration errors distributed between 0 and 10 mm with approximate uniformity. For each misregistered image pair each observer estimated the registration error (in millimeters) at each of 5 locations distributed around the head using each of 3 assessment methods. These estimated errors were compared with the e- - rrors as measured by the gold standard to determine agreement relative to each of the 6 thresholds, where agreement means that the 2 errors lie on the same side of the threshold. The effect of error in the gold standard itself is taken into account in the analysis of the assessment methods. The results were analyzed by means of the Kappa statistic, the agreement rate, and the area of receiver-operating-characteristic ({ROC}) curves. No assessment performed well at 1 mm, but all methods performed well at 2 mm and higher. For these 5 thresholds, 2 methods agreed with the standard at least 80\% of the time and exhibited mean {ROC} areas greater than 0.84. One of these same methods exhibited Kappa statistics that indicated good agreement relative to chance (Kappa{\textgreater}0.6) between the pooled observers and the standard for these same 5 thresholds. Further analysis demonstrates that the results depend strongly on the choice of the distribution of misregistration errors presented to the observers.},

	abstract = {Objective: To characterize long-term mortality following intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) in two large population-based cohorts assembled more than a decade apart.
Methods: All patients age ≥18 hospitalized with nontraumatic {ICH} in the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky area were identified during 1988 (Cohort 1) and from May 1998 to July 2001 and August 2002 to April 2003 (Cohort 2). Mortality was tabulated using actuarial methods and compared with a log-rank test.
Results: There were 183 patients with {ICH} in Cohort 1 and 1,041 patients in Cohort 2. Patients in Cohort 1 were more likely to be white (p = 0.024) and undergo operation for their {ICH} (p = 0.002), whereas patients in Cohort 2 were more commonly on anticoagulants (p {\textless} 0.001). Among patients in Cohort 1, mortality at 7 days, 1 year, and 10 years was 31, 59, and 82\%. Among patients in Cohort 2, mortality at 7 days and 1 year was 34 and 53\%. Mortality rates did not differ between cohorts by log-rank test (p = 0.259).
Conclusions: Intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) mortality did not improve significantly between study periods. Operation for {ICH} became less frequent, whereas anticoagulant-associated {ICH} became more common.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose-We conducted this study to determine, through use of multivariate analyses, the independent predictors of hematoma enlargement occurring after hospital admission in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}).
Methods-We reviewed 627 patients with {ICH} admitted within 24 hours of onset. The first {CT} was performed at admission and the second within 24 hours of admission, and a blood sample was taken for laboratory examinations. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the relationships between hematoma enlargement and time from onset, consciousness level, {CT} findings, amount of alcohol consumption, systolic blood pressure at and after admission, clinical outcome, and hematologic parameters.
Results-Eighty-eight patients (14.0\%) showed enlarged hematomas after admission. Multivariate analyses revealed that the following five factors were independently associated with hematoma enlargement: the time from onset (odds ratio [{OR}], 0.26 for a 1-{SD} change; 4.9 hours; P{\textless}0.001); the amount of alcohol consumption ({OR}, 1.50 for 1 {SD}; 46.3 g/d; P=0.002); the sharp of hematoma ({OR}, 1.40 for 1 {SD}; 0.45 round; P=0.006); the presence of consciousness disturbance ({OR}, 1.38 for 1 {SD}; 0.50 coma; P=0.026); and the level of fibrinogen ({OR}, 0.74 for 1 {SD}; 87.1 mg/{dL}; P=0.042). Hematoma enlargement was an independent factor increasing the mortality rate in the {ICH} patients ({OR}, 1.57; P{\textless}0.001).
Conclusions-A particularly high likelihood of hematoma enlargement was observed in patients who (in order of importance) were admitted shortly after onset, who were heavy drinkers; who had an irregularly shaped hematoma, whose consciousness was disturbed, and who had a low level of fibrinogen.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose-Intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) constitutes 10\% to 15\% of all strokes and remains without a treatment of proven benefit. Despite several existing outcome prediction models for {ICH}, there is no standard clinical grading scale for {ICH} analogous to those for traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or ischemic stroke.
Methods-Records of all patients with acute {ICH} presenting to the University of California, San Francisco during 1997-1998 were reviewed. Independent predictors of 30-day mortality were identified by logistic regression. A risk stratification scale (the {ICH} Score) was developed with weighting of independent predictors based on strength of association.
Results-Factors independently associated with 30-day mortality were Glasgow Coma Scale score (P{\textless}0.001), age ≥80 years (P=0.001), infratentorial origin of {ICH} (P=0.03), {ICH} volume (P=0.047), and presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (P=0.052). The {ICH} Score was the sum of individual points assigned as follows: {GCS} score 3 to 4 (=2 points), 5 to 12 (=1), 13 to 15 (=0); age ≥80 years yes (=1), no (=0); infratentorial origin yes (=1), no (=0); {ICH} volume ≥30 cm3 (=1), {\textless}30 cm3 (=0); and intraventricular hemorrhage yes (=1), no (=0). All 26 patients with an {ICH} Score of 0 survived, and all 6 patients with an {ICH} Score of 5 died. Thirty-day mortality increased steadily with {ICH} Score (P{\textless}0.005).
Conclusions-The {ICH} Score is a simple clinical grading scale that allows risk stratification on presentation with {ICH}. The use of a scale such as the {ICH} Score could improve standardization of clinical treatment protocols and clinical research studies in {ICH}.},

Combined with the expectation maximization ({EM}) algorithm, and a hybrid of pre- and post-processing techniques, incorporating mathematical morphology and connected component analysis, geodesic active contours are evolved in 3D space to segment the cortex. The robustness and accuracy of our proposed method are validated with both synthetic and real {MRI} data. Our method outperforms standard techniques including the brain extraction tool ({BET}) and statistical parametric mapping ({SPM}) by lowering the misclassification rate, especially when analyzing real {MRI} data},

	abstract = {Background
{TMS} (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and {DTT} (diffusion tensor tractography) have different advantages in evaluating stroke patients. {TMS} has good clinical accessibility and economical benefit. On the contrary, {DTT} has a unique advantage to visualize neural tracts three-dimensionally although it requires an expensive and large {MRI} machine. Many studies have demonstrated that {TMS} and {DTT} have predictive values for motor outcome in stroke patients. However, there has been no study on the comparison of these two evaluation tools. In the current study, we compared the abilities of {TMS} and {DTT} to predict upper motor outcome in patients with {ICH} (intracerebral hemorrhage).
Methods
Fifty-three consecutive patients with severe motor weakness were evaluated by {TMS} and {DTT} at the early stage (7-28 days) of {ICH}. Modified Brunnstrom classification ({MBC}) and the motricity index of upper extremity ({UMI}) were evaluated at onset and 6 months after onset.
Results
Patients with the presence of a motor evoked potential ({MEP}) in {TMS} or a preserved corticospinal tract ({CST}) in {DTT} showed better motor outcomes than those without (p = 0.000). {TMS} showed higher positive predictive value than {DTT}. In contrast, {DTT} showed higher negative predictive value than {TMS}.
Conclusions
{TMS} and {DTT} had different advantages in predicting motor outcome, and this result could be a reference to predict final neurological deficit at the early stage of {ICH}.},

The consistent landmark and intensity registration algorithm produces good correspondences between images near landmark locations by matching corresponding landmarks and away from landmark locations by matching the image intensities. In contrast to similar unidirectional algorithms, these new consistent algorithms jointly estimate the forward and reverse transformation between two images while minimizing the inverse consistency error-the error between the forward (reverse) transformation and the inverse of the the reverse (forward) transformation. This reduces the ambiguous correspondence between the forward and reverse transformations associated with large inverse consistency errors. In both algorithms a thin-plate spline ({TPS}) model is used to regularize the estimated transformations. Two-dimensional (2-D) examples are presented that show the inverse consistency error produced by the traditional unidirectional landmark {TPS} algorithm can be relatively large and that this error is minimized using the consistent landmark algorithm. Results using 2-D magnetic resonance imaging data are presented that demonstrate that using landmark and intensity information together produce better correspondence between medical images than using either landmarks or intensity information alone.},

Multiple databases were searched for relevant studies published between 1990 and 2010. The {GBD} 2010 study provided standardized estimates of the incidence, mortality, mortality-to-incidence ratios ({MIR}), and disability-adjusted life years ({DALY}) lost for {HS} (including intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage) by age, sex, and income level (high-income countries [{HIC}]; low- and middle-income countries [{LMIC}]) for 21 {GBD} 2010 regions in 1990, 2005, and 2010. In 2010, there were 5.3 million cases of {HS} and over 3.0 million deaths due to {HS}. There was a 47\% increase worldwide in the absolute number of {HS} cases. The largest proportion of {HS} incident cases (80\%) and deaths (63\%) occurred in {LMIC} countries. There were 62.8 million {DALY} lost (86\% in {LMIC}) due to {HS}. The overall age-standardized incidence rate of {HS} per 100,000 person-years in 2010 was 48.41 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 45.44 to 52.13) in {HIC} and 99.43 (95\% {CI}: 85.37 to 116.28) in {LMIC}, and 81.52 (95\% {CI}: 72.27 to 92.82) globally. The age-standardized incidence of {HS} increased by 18.5\% worldwide between 1990 and 2010. In {HIC}, there was a reduction in incidence of {HS} by 8\% (95\% {CI}: 1\% to 15\%), mortality by 38\% (95\% {CI}: 32\% to 43\%), {DALY} by 39\% (95\% {CI}: 32\% to 44\%), and {MIR} by 27\% (95\% {CI}: 19\% to 35\%) in the last 2 decades. In {LMIC} countries, there was a significant increase in the incidence of {HS} by 22\% (95\% {CI}: 5\% to 30\%), whereas there was a significant reduction in mortality rates of 23\% (95\% {CI}: -3\% to 36\%), {DALY} lost of 25\% (95\% {CI}: 7\% to 38\%), and {MIR} by 36\% (95\% {CI}: 16\% to 49\%). There were significant regional differences in incidence rates of {HS}, with the highest rates in {LMIC} regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, and lowest rates in High Income North America and Western Europe. The worldwide burden of {HS} has increased over the last 2 decades in terms of absolute numbers of {HS} incident events. The majority of the burden of {HS} is borne by {LMIC}. Rates for {HS} incidence, mortality, and {DALY} lost, as well as {MIR} decreased in the past 2 decades in {HIC}, but increased significantly in {LMIC} countries, particularly in those patients ≤75 years. {HS} affected people at a younger age in {LMIC} than in {HIC}. The lowest incidence and mortality rates in 2010 were in High Income North America, Australasia, and Western Europe, whereas the highest rates were in Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. These results suggest that reducing the burden of {HS} is a priority particularly in {LMIC}. The {GBD} 2010 findings may be a useful resource for planning strategies to reduce the global burden of {HS}.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose The clinical features of thalamic hemorrhage in terms of localization are of great interest in many studies. To better understand the relationship between the localization of thalamic hemorrhage and clinical features, we evaluated the characteristics of patients with four different topographic types of thalamic hemorrhage.
Methods We prospectively studied 100 patients with thalamic hemorrhage who were admitted consecutively to our primary care unit. We divided them into two groups according to large ({\textgreater}2 cm in diameter and/or {\textgreater}4 {mL} in volume) and small thalamic hemorrhage. Four topographic subgroups (large and small) were compared to identify clinical syndromes associated with distinct lesion locations.
Results All patients with posterolateral thalamic hemorrhage had severe sensorimotor deficit. Neuropsychological disturbances in patients with posterolateral thalamic hemorrhage were prominent, with primarily transcortical aphasia in those with left-sided lesions and hemineglect and anosognosia in those with right-sided lesions. Several variants of vertical gaze dysfunction, skew ocular deviation, gaze preference toward the site of the lesion, and miotic pupils were frequent in posterolateral thalamic hemorrhage, particularly in the large type. Patients with small and large anterolateral thalamic hemorrhage were characterized by severe motor and sensory deficits; language and oculomotor disturbances were also observed, although less frequently than in posterolateral hemorrhage. Sensorimotor deficits were observed in patients with medial thalamic hemorrhage (moderate in small hemorrhages and severe in large hemorrhages because of involvement of the adjacent internal capsule). Language disturbances in patients with left-sided lesions and neglect in patients with right-sided lesions were seen only in large medial thalamic hemorrhage. Dorsal thalamic hemorrhage was rare and characterized by mild and transient sensorimotor disturbances. Among patients with dorsal thalamic hemorrhages, only those with large lesions had oculomotor and neuropsychological disturbances.
Conclusions We concluded that despite clinical similarity among the four types of thalamic hemorrhage, there was some discrepancy in the clinical features of small and large thalamic hemorrhages. The most important predictors of death were initial consciousness, nuchal rigidity, maximum size, volume and ventricular extension of hemorrhage, and occurrence of hydrocephalus.},

This study specifically addressed patients seen in the emergency room within a few hours of the ictus, many of whom were still awake, to identify and subsequently exclude from surgical procedure those expected to recover completely and those expected to die regardless of treatment. We retrospectively studied 75 patients evaluated at a mean time of 3 hours and 37 minutes after hemispheric {ICH} to determine factors that would predict both good and poor outcomes at the time of discharge. Eighty percent of our patients presented within 6 hours of symptom onset. These patients were younger and had more severe lesions than did those presenting later, yet most were still awake (mean admission Glasgow Coma Scale [{GCS}] score = 11.0). Using multivariate regression, we created two models. The first model predicts independent outcome, i.e, Rankin 0 to 2, of all patients with a {GCS} score greater than 9 on admission who do not undergo surgery. The significant factors in this model were hemorrhage diameter, intraventricular extension, and age. The second model predicts poor outcome, i.e, Rankin 5 and death, of all patients. {GCS} score, hemorrhage volume, age, and gender were the important factors in this model. We conclude that {ICH} patients presenting early to the emergency room have more severe lesions radiologically, although their initial clinical status may not be different from those seen late. Our models should identify and thus exclude those with very good and very poor prognoses from future randomized surgical trials.},

	abstract = {Automatic computer processing of large multidimensional images such as those produced by magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) is greatly aided by deformable models, which are used to extract, identify, and quantify specific neuroanatomic structures. A general method of deforming polyhedra is presented here, with two novel features. First, explicit prevention of self-intersecting surface geometries is provided, unlike conventional deformable models, which use regularization constraints to discourage but not necessarily prevent such behavior. Second, deformation of multiple surfaces with intersurface proximity constraints allows each surface to help guide other surfaces into place using model-based constraints such as expected thickness of an anatomic surface. These two features are used advantageously to identify automatically the total surface of the outer and inner boundaries of cerebral cortical gray matter from normal human {MR} images, accurately locating the depths of the sulci, even where noise and partial volume artifacts in the image obscure the visibility of sulci. The extracted surfaces are enforced to be simple two-dimensional manifolds (having the topology of a sphere), even though the data may have topological holes. This automatic 3-D cortex segmentation technique has been applied to 150 normal subjects, simultaneously extracting both the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid interface from each individual. The collection of surfaces has been used to create a spatial map of the mean and standard deviation for the location and the thickness of cortical gray matter. Three alternative criteria for defining cortical thickness at each cortical location were developed and compared. These results are shown to corroborate published postmortem and in vivo measurements of cortical thickness.},

In this paper, we investigate the performance of various optimization methods and multiresolution strategies for maximization of mutual information, aiming at increasing registration speed when matching large high-resolution images. We show that mutual information is a continuous function of the affine registration parameters when appropriate interpolation is used and we derive analytic expressions of its derivatives that allow numerically exact evaluation of its gradient. Various multiresolution gradient- and non-gradient-based optimization strategies, such as Powell, simplex, steepest-descent, conjugate-gradient, quasi-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt methods, are evaluated for registration of computed tomography ({CT}) and magnetic resonance images of the brain. Speed-ups of a factor of 3 on average compared to Powell's method at full resolution are achieved with similar precision and without a loss of robustness with the simplex, conjugate-gradient and Levenberg-Marquardt method using a two-level multiresolution scheme. Large data sets such as 2562 × 128 {MR} and 5122 × 48 {CT} images can be registered with subvoxel precision in {\textless} 5 min {CPU} time on current workstations.},

The first step is automatic determination of head symmetry axis, with the possibility of manual improvement of the result if necessary. Symmetry axis calculation is based on moments. In the second step, the seeded region-growing ({SRG}) algorithm is used to segment the input image into a number of regions having uniform brightness. Features of these regions, such as brightness, area, neighborhood and relative position to the symmetry axis are used to create facts for a rule-based expert system. Based on created facts and pre-defined rules as input, the rule-based expert system is used in the third step to label regions as background, skull, gray/white matter, {CSF} and stroke.

	doi = {10.1109/42.736031},
	abstract = {Most previously reported registration techniques that align three-dimensional image volumes by matching geometrical features such as points or surfaces use a single type of feature. The authors recently reported a hybrid registration technique that uses a weighted combination of multiple geometrical feature shapes. In this study they use the weighted geometrical feature ({WGF}) algorithm to register computed tomography ({CT}) images of the head to physical space using the skin surface only, the bone surface only, and various weighted combinations of these surfaces and one fiducial point (centroid of a bone-implanted marker). The authors use data acquired from 12 patients that underwent temporal lobe craniotomies for the resection of cerebral lesions. The authors evaluate and compare the accuracy of the registrations obtained using these various approaches by using as a reference gold standard the registration obtained using three bone-implanted markers. The results demonstrate that a combination of geometrical features can improve the accuracy of {CT}-to-physical space registration. Point-based registration requires a minimum of three noncollinear points. The position of a bone-implanted marker can be determined much more accurately than that of a skin-affixed marker or an anatomic landmark. A major disadvantage of using bone-implanted markers is that an invasive procedure is required to implant each marker. By combining surface information, the {WGF} algorithm allows registration to be performed using only one or two such markers. One important finding is that the use of a single, very accurate point (a bone-implanted marker) allows very accurate surface-based registration to be achieved using very few surface points. Finally, the {WGF} algorithm, which not only allows the combination of multiple types of geometrical information but also handles point-based and surface-based registration as degenerate cases, could form the foundation of a "flexible" surgical navigation syste- - m that allows the surgeon to use what he considers the method most appropriate for an individual clinical situation.},

Through an International Consortium for Brain Mapping ({ICBM}) a dataset is being collected that includes 7000 subjects between the ages of eighteen and ninety years and including 342 mono- and dizygotic twins. Data on each subject includes detailed demographic, clinical, behavioural and imaging information. {DNA} has been collected for genotyping from 5800 subjects. A component of the programme uses post-mortem tissue to determine the probabilistic distribution of microscopic cyto- and chemoarchitectural regions in the human brain. This, combined with macroscopic information about structure and function derived from subjects in vivo, provides the first large scale opportunity to gain meaningful insights into the concordance or discordance in micro- and macroscopic structure and function. The philosophy, strategy, algorithm development, data acquisition techniques and validation methods are described in this report along with database structures. Examples of results are described for the normal adult human brain as well as examples in patients with Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The ability to quantify the variance of the human brain as a function of age in a large population of subjects for whom data is also available about their genetic composition and behaviour will allow for the first assessment of cerebral genotype-phenotype-behavioural correlations in humans to take place in a population this large. This approach and its application should provide new insights and opportunities for investigators interested in basic neuroscience, clinical diagnostics and the evaluation of neuropsychiatric disorders in patients.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage accounts for 20\% of all stroke-related sudden neurological deficits, has the highest morbidity and mortality of all stroke, and the role of surgery remains controversial. We undertook a prospective randomised trial to compare early surgery with initial conservative treatment for patients with intracerebral haemorrhage.
A parallel-group trial design was used. Early surgery combined haematoma evacuation (within 24 h of randomisation) with medical treatment. Initial conservative treatment used medical treatment, although later evacuation was allowed if necessary. We used the eight-point Glasgow outcome scale obtained by postal questionnaires sent directly to patients at 6 months follow-up as the primary outcome measure. We divided the patients into good and poor prognosis groups on the basis of their clinical status at randomisation. For the good prognosis group, a favourable outcome was defined as good recovery or moderate disability on the Glasgow outcome scale. For the poor prognosis group, a favourable outcome also included the upper level of severe disability. Analysis was by intention to treat.
1033 patients from 83 centres in 27 countries were randomised to early surgery (503) or initial conservative treatment (530). At 6 months, 51 patients were lost to follow-up, and 17 were alive with unknown status. Of 468 patients randomised to early surgery, 122 (26\%) had a favourable outcome compared with 118 (24\%) of 496 randomised to initial conservative treatment (odds ratio 0·89 [95\% {CI} 0·66-1·19], p=0·414); absolute benefit 2·3\% (-3·2 to 7·7), relative benefit 10\% (-13 to 33).

	abstract = {The balance of risk and benefit from early neurosurgical intervention for conscious patients with superficial lobar intracerebral haemorrhage of 10-100 {mL} and no intraventricular haemorrhage admitted within 48 h of ictus is unclear. We therefore tested the hypothesis that early surgery compared with initial conservative treatment could improve outcome in these patients.
In this international, parallel-group trial undertaken in 78 centres in 27 countries, we compared early surgical haematoma evacuation within 12 h of randomisation plus medical treatment with initial medical treatment alone (later evacuation was allowed if judged necessary). An automatic telephone and internet-based randomisation service was used to assign patients to surgery and initial conservative treatment in a 1:1 ratio. The trial was not masked. The primary outcome was a prognosis-based dichotomised (favourable or unfavourable) outcome of the 8 point Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale ({GOSE}) obtained by questionnaires posted to patients at 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number {ISRCTN}22153967.
307 of 601 patients were randomly assigned to early surgery and 294 to initial conservative treatment; 298 and 291 were followed up at 6 months, respectively; and 297 and 286 were included in the analysis, respectively. 174 (59\%) of 297 patients in the early surgery group had an unfavourable outcome versus 178 (62\%) of 286 patients in the initial conservative treatment group (absolute difference 3·7\% [95\% {CI} -4·3 to 11·6], odds ratio 0·86 [0·62 to 1·20]; p=0·367).
The {STICH} {II} results confirm that early surgery does not increase the rate of death or disability at 6 months and might have a small but clinically relevant survival advantage for patients with spontaneous superficial intracerebral haemorrhage without intraventricular haemorrhage.

Methods- We developed atlases consisting of location-weighted values indicating the relative importance in terms of neurological deficit severity for every voxel of the brain. These atlases were applied to 80 first-ever ischemic stroke patients to produce estimates of clinical deficit severity. Each patient had an {MRI} and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ({NIHSS}) examination just before or soon after hospital discharge. The correlation between the location-based deficit predictions and measured neurological deficit ({NIHSS}) scores were compared with the correlation obtained using volume alone to predict the neurological deficit.
Results- Volume-based estimates of neurological deficit severity were only moderately correlated with measured {NIHSS} scores (r=0.62). The combination of volume and location resulted in a significantly better correlation with clinical deficit severity (r=0.79, P=0.032).
Conclusions- The atlas methodology is a feasible way of integrating infarct size and location to predict stroke severity. It can estimate stroke severity better than volume alone.},

Prerelease review of the draft guideline was performed by 6 expert peer reviewers and by the members of the Stroke Council Scientific Statements Oversight Committee and Stroke Council Leadership Committee. It is intended that this guideline be fully updated in 3 years' time.
Results-Evidence-based guidelines are presented for the care of patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage. The focus was subdivided into diagnosis, hemostasis, blood pressure management, inpatient and nursing management, preventing medical comorbidities, surgical treatment, outcome prediction, rehabilitation, prevention of recurrence, and future considerations.
Conclusions-Intracerebral hemorrhage is a serious medical condition for which outcome can be impacted by early, aggressive care. The guidelines offer a framework for goal-directed treatment of the patient with intracerebral hemorrhage.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose-Perihematomal edema ({PHE}) can worsen outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}). Reports suggest that blood degradation products lead to {PHE}. We hypothesized that hematoma evacuation will reduce {PHE} volume and that treatment with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-{PA}) will not exacerbate it.
Methods-Minimally invasive surgery and rt-{PA} in {ICH} evacuation ({MISTIE}) phase {II} tested safety and efficacy of hematoma evacuation after {ICH}. We conducted a semiautomated, computerized volumetric analysis on computed tomography to assess impact of hematoma removal on {PHE} and effects of rt-{PA} on {PHE}. Volumetric analyses were performed on baseline stability and end of treatment scans.
Results-Seventy-nine surgical and 39 medical patients from minimally invasive surgery and rt-{PA} in {ICH} evacuation phase {II} ({MISTIE} {II}) were analyzed. Mean hematoma volume at end of treatment was 19.6±14.5 cm3 for the surgical cohort and 40.7±13.9 cm3 for the medical cohort (P{\textless}0.001). Edema volume at end of treatment was lower for the surgical cohort: 27.7±13.3 cm3 than medical cohort: 41.7±14.6 cm3 (P{\textless}0.001). Graded effect of clot removal on {PHE} was observed when patients with {\textgreater}65\%, 20\% to 65\%, and {\textless}20\% {ICH} removed were analyzed (P{\textless}0.001). Positive correlation between {PHE} reduction and percent of {ICH} removed was identified (ρ=0.658; P{\textless}0.001). In the surgical cohort, 69 patients underwent surgical aspiration and rt-{PA}, whereas 10 underwent surgical aspiration only. Both cohorts achieved similar clot reduction: surgical aspiration and rt-{PA}, 18.9±14.5 cm3; and surgical aspiration only, 24.5±14.0 cm3 (P=0.26). Edema at end of treatment in surgical aspiration and rt-{PA} was 28.1±13.8 cm3 and 24.4±8.6 cm3 in surgical aspiration only (P=0.41).
Conclusions-Hematoma evacuation is associated with significant reduction in {PHE}. Furthermore, {PHE} does not seem to be exacerbated by rt-{PA}, making such neurotoxic effects unlikely when the drug is delivered to intracranial clot.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to establish single-participant white matter atlases based on diffusion tensor imaging. As one of the applications of the atlas, automated brain segmentation was performed and the accuracy was measured using Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping ({LDDMM}). High-quality diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) data from a single-participant were B0-distortion-corrected and transformed to the {ICBM}-152 atlas or to Talairach coordinates. The deep white matter structures, which have been previously well documented and clearly identified by {DTI}, were manually segmented. The superficial white matter areas beneath the cortex were defined, based on a population-averaged white matter probability map. The white matter was parcellated into 176 regions based on the anatomical labeling in the {ICBM}-{DTI}-81 atlas. The automated parcellation was achieved by warping this parcellation map to normal controls and to Alzheimer's disease patients with severe anatomical atrophy. The parcellation accuracy was measured by a kappa analysis between the automated and manual parcellation at 11 anatomical regions. The kappa values were 0.70 for both normal controls and patients while the inter-rater reproducibility was 0.81 (controls) and 0.82 (patients), suggesting “almost perfect” agreement. A power analysis suggested that the proposed method is suitable for detecting {FA} and size abnormalities of the white matter in clinical studies.},

The white matter has been structurally defined in the past only at its core regions (deep white matter).

We used axonal fiber alignment information from diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) to delineate the peripheral white matter, and investigated its relationship with the cortex and the deep white matter. Using {DTI} data from 81 healthy subjects, we identified nine common, blade-like anatomical regions, which were further parcellated into 21 subregions based on the cortical anatomy. Four short association fiber tracts connecting adjacent gyri (U-fibers) were also identified reproducibly among the healthy population. We anticipate that this atlas will be useful resource for atlas-based white matter anatomical studies.},

	abstract = {Treatment of primary {SICH} is still controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of craniotomy and early hematoma evacuation vs nonoperative management in patients with {SICH}.
A prospective randomized study of craniotomy and early hematoma removal vs best medical management was performed in 108 patients with primary {SICH}. Surgical or medical treatment was initiated within 8 hours post ictus. Principal eligibility criterium was the presence of neurologic impairment associated with a spontaneous subcortical or putaminal hemorrhage bigger than 30 {mL}. Outcomes were assessed at 1 year post ictus.
Analysis of outcome revealed a significantly higher percentage of {GOS} scores higher than 3 for the surgical patients, compared with those of the conservative group (33\% and 9\%, respectively; P {\textless} .05). By contrast, the mortality rates between operated and conservatively managed patients did not differ significantly. The main prognostic variables were the initial neurologic status, hematoma volume, and location. Stratifications of these parameters and analysis showed that the positive effect of surgery on the quality of survival was statistically not valid for patients with {GCS} scores lower than 8 or {ICH} volumes 80 {mL} or higher at the time of enrollment.
The study demonstrates that surgical patients with subcortical or putaminal hematomas showed better functional results than their conservatively treated counterparts. However, early {ICH} evacuation failed to improve the survival rates, as compared with best medical management.},

Methods based only on ‘at risk' volumes or initial neurological condition do predict eventual outcome, but not perfectly. Given the close relationship between anatomy and function in the brain, we performed a proof-of-concept study to examine how well stroke outcome correlated with infarct location and extent. A prospective study of 60 patients with ischemic stroke (38 in the training set and 22 in the validation set), using an implementation of partial least squares with penalized logistic regression ({PLS}-{PLR}), was performed. The method yielded a model relating location of infarction (on a voxel-by-voxel basis) and neurological deficits. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve ({AUC}) method was used to assess the accuracy of the method for predicting outcome. In the validation phase, this model indicated the presence of neglect ({AUC} 0.89), aphasia ({AUC} 0.79), right-arm motor deficit (0.94), and right-leg motor deficit ({AUC} 0.94) but less accurately indicated left-arm motor deficit (0.52) and left-leg motor deficit (0.69). The model indicated no to mild disability (Rankin ≤ 2) versus moderate to severe disability (Rankin \&gt; 2) with {AUC} 0.78. In this proof-of-concept study, we have demonstrated that stroke outcome correlates well with infarct location raising the possibility of accurate prediction of neurological deficit in the individual stroke patient using only information on infarct location and multivariate regression methods.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose-Previous studies have shown that the volume of intracerebral hemorrhage and Glasgow Coma Score ({GCS}) on admission are powerful predictors of 30-day mortality. However, the significance of hydrocephalus associated with deep cerebral hemorrhage has not been studied extensively. The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic indicators of 30-day mortality in patients with deep cerebral hemorrhage.
Methods-We studied 100 consecutive patients with deep cerebral hemorrhage between 1994 and 1998. Deep cerebral hemorrhage was divided into 2 groups: putaminal hemorrhage (lateral group) and thalamic and caudate hemorrhage (medial group). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent prognostic indicators of 30-day mortality.
Results-Hydrocephalus was present in 40 of the 100 patients. The 30-day mortality was 29\%, and hydrocephalus was present in 76\% of those who died. Multivariate analyses showed 2 independent prognostic indicators of 30-day mortality for putaminal hemorrhage: {GCS} ≤8 (P=0.002, odds ratio [{OR}] 37.7, {CI} 3.6 to 396.9) and hydrocephalus (P=0.005, {OR} 27.4, {CI} 2.7 to 282.6). However, only {GCS} ≤8 (P=0.0002, {OR} 16.5, {CI} 3.7 to 73.4) was predictive of 30-day mortality for thalamic and caudate hemorrhage. This model ({GCS} ≤8 and hydrocephalus) has a sensitivity of 57\% and a specificity of 91\% for predicting 30-day mortality for putaminal hemorrhage. When both attributes were present in putaminal hemorrhage ({GCS} ≤8 and hydrocephalus), 1 (11\%) of 9 patients survived, and when both attributes were missing 28 (100\%) of 28 patients survived.
Conclusions-Obstructive hydrocephalus on admission in a comatose patient with a putaminal hemorrhage predicts 30-day mortality.},

	abstract = {Depth intracranial electrodes ({IEs}) placement is one of the most used procedures to identify the epileptogenic zone ({EZ}) in surgical treatment of drug resistant epilepsy patients, about 20-30\% of this population. {IEs} localization is therefore a critical issue defining the {EZ} and its relation with eloquent functional areas. That information is then used to target the resective surgery and has great potential to affect outcome. We designed a methodological procedure intended to avoid the need for highly specialized medical resources and reduce time to identify the anatomical location of {IEs}, during the first instances of intracranial {EEG} recordings. This workflow is based on established open source software; 3D Slicer and Freesurfer that uses {MRI} and Post-implant {CT} fusion for the localization of {IEs} and its relation with automatic labeled surrounding cortex. To test this hypothesis we assessed the time elapsed between the surgical implantation process and the final anatomical localization of {IEs} by means of our proposed method compared against traditional visual analysis of raw post-implant imaging in two groups of patients. All {IEs} were identified in the first 24 H (6-24 H) of implantation using our method in 4 patients of the first group. For the control group; all {IEs} were identified by experts with an overall time range of 36 h to 3 days using traditional visual analysis. It included (7 patients), 3 patients implanted with {IEs} and the same 4 patients from the first group. Time to localization was restrained in this group by the specialized personnel and the image quality available. To validate our method; we trained two inexperienced operators to assess the position of {IEs} contacts on four patients (5 {IEs}) using the proposed method. We quantified the discrepancies between operators and we also assessed the efficiency of our method to define the {EZ} comparing the findings against the results of traditional analysis.},

Although the number of hospital admissions for intracerebral haemorrhage has increased worldwide in the past 10 years, mortality has not fallen. Results of clinical trials and observational studies suggest that coordinated primary and specialty care is associated with lower mortality than is typical community practice. Development of treatment goals for critical care, and new sequences of care and specialty practice can improve outcome after intracerebral haemorrhage. Specific treatment approaches include early diagnosis and haemostasis, aggressive management of blood pressure, open surgical and minimally invasive surgical techniques to remove clot, techniques to remove intraventricular blood, and management of intracranial pressure. These approaches improve clinical management of patients with intracerebral haemorrhage and promise to reduce mortality and increase functional survival.},

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of clinical characteristics and initial {CT} scan for outcome in black Americans with {SICH}.
Methods Clinical and demographic data were extracted from the charts of 182 consecutive black Americans admitted for {SICH} diagnosed by clinical criteria and initial {CT} scan. Hemorrhage volumes were calculated from admission {CT} scans by a computerized method. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent predictors of early deterioration (defined as a decrease from an initial Glasgow Coma Scale score {\textgreater}12 by ≥4 points within 24 hours from presentation) and mortality.
Results Both hemorrhage volume and ventricular extension were significant, independent predictors of early deterioration (odds ratio [{OR}], 6.78; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.89 to 24.35 and {OR}, 4.67; 95\% {CI}, 1.30 to 16.72, respectively) and mortality ({OR}, 6.66; 95\% {CI}, 2.85 to 15.58 and {OR}, 4.23; 95\% {CI}, 1.82 to 9.82, respectively). A Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤12 also predicted mortality ({OR}, 3.23; 95\% {CI}, 1.46 to 7.14). Initial mean arterial pressure was not an independent predictor of early deterioration or mortality.
Conclusions Hemorrhage volume and ventricular extension are the best predictors of early deterioration and mortality in black Americans with {SICH}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} The present study was undertaken to evaluate the determinants of acute (30-day) mortality after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) in a developing country setting, and to compare these findings with those available from studies conducted in the West.
{METHODS} Medical records of 146 patients admitted to a major tertiary hospital in Karachi, Pakistan between 1990 and 1991 with a diagnosis of spontaneous {ICH} were reviewed. The level and intensity of care provided to these patients was similar to that available at modern neurosurgical centers. The salient prognostic indicators that were studied included hypertension, pulse pressure, {GCS} score, neurologic deficits, and {CT}-scan predictors including site, size, and intraventricular spread of hemorrhage. These data were used to determine independent predictors of 30-day mortality by univariate and multivariate analysis. Additionally, 30-day survival probabilities for these outcome predictors were also computed.
{RESULTS} The 30-day mortality after spontaneous {ICH} was 39.7\%. Two-thirds of the patients had a history of hypertension. The important clinical predictors at the multivariate level included {GCS} score ≤8 and progressive increase in pulse pressure. The {CT} scan predictors included intraventricular spread of hemorrhage, ventricular enlargement, and size of the bleed. Location of the lesion did not appear to significantly influence mortality. Survival analysis showed a large clustering of deaths within the first 72 hours of hospitalization.
{CONCLUSIONS} The 30-day mortality rate and prognostic predictors for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage were found to be similar to those reported in the Western hemisphere. However, the correlation of incremental increase in pulse pressure with deteriorating prognosis was a new and significant finding.},

Automating this procedure can eliminate intra- and interrater variance and greatly increase throughput for a labor-intensive step. Many available procedures perform differently across anatomy and under different acquisition protocols. We developed the Brain Extraction Meta-Algorithm ({BEMA}) to address these concerns. It executes many extraction algorithms and a registration procedure in parallel to combine the results in an intelligent fashion and obtain improved results over any of the individual algorithms. Using an atlas space, {BEMA} performs a voxelwise analysis of training data to determine the optimal Boolean combination of extraction algorithms to produce the most accurate result for a given voxel. This allows the provided extractors to be used differentially across anatomy, increasing both the accuracy and robustness of the procedure. We tested {BEMA} using modified forms of {BrainSuite}'s Brain Surface Extractor ({BSE}), {FSL}'s Brain Extraction Tool ({BET}), {AFNI}'s 3dIntracranial, and {FreeSurfer}'s {MRI} Watershed as well as {FSL}'s {FLIRT} for the registration procedure. Training was performed on T1-weighted scans of 136 subjects from five separate data sets with different acquisition parameters on separate scanners. Testing was performed on 135 separate subjects from the same data sets. {BEMA} outperformed the individual algorithms, as well as interrater results from a subset of the scans, when compared for the mean Dice coefficient, a rating of the similarity of output masks to the manually defined gold standards.},

Presenting brains in this format is useful as the slices correspond to the standard anatomical atlases used by neuroimagers. In addition, lesion position and volume are directly comparable across patients. This article describes freely available software for presenting stereotaxically aligned patient scans. This article focuses on {MRI} scans, but many of these tools are also applicable to other modalities (e.g. {CT}, {PET} and {SPECT}).

The most popular standard templates are derived from {MRI} scans of young adults. We introduce specialized templates that allow normalization algorithms to be applied to stroke-aged populations. First, we developed a {CT} template: while this is the dominant modality for many clinical situations, there are no modern {CT} templates and popular algorithms fail to successfully normalize {CT} scans. Importantly, our template was based on healthy individuals with ages similar to what is commonly seen in stroke (mean 65 years old). This template allows studies where only {CT} scans are available. Second, we derived a {MRI} template that approximately matches the shape of our {CT} template as well as processing steps that aid the normalization of scans from older individuals (including lesion masking and the ability to generate high quality cortical renderings despite brain injury). The benefit of this strategy is that the resulting templates can be used in studies where mixed modalities are present. We have integrated these templates and processing algorithms into a simple {SPM} toolbox (http://www.mricro.com/clinical-toolbox/spm8-scripts).},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose-Reduction in infarct volume is the standard measure of therapeutic success in animal stroke models. Reduction in infarct volume has been advocated as a biological surrogate or auxiliary outcome measure for human stroke clinical trials to replace or supplement deficit, disability, and global clinical scales. However, few studies have investigated correlations between infarct volume and clinical end points in acute ischemic stroke patients.
Methods-{CT} scans at days 6 to 11 were acquired prospectively in 191 fully eligible patients enrolled in the Randomized Trial of Tirilazad Mesylate in Patients With Acute Stroke ({RANTTAS}). Patients were enrolled within 6 hours of onset of stroke in any vessel distribution. Infarct volume was measured by operator-assisted computerized planimetry.
Results-One hundred thirty-two patients had visible new supratentorial infarcts, with median infarct volume of 28.0 cm3 (interquartile range, 9.0 to 93.0 cm3). Fifty-nine patients had no visible new infarct. Correlations with standard 3-month outcome scales and mortality were as follows: Barthel Index, r=0.43; Glasgow Outcome Scale, r=0.53; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, r=0.54; mortality, r=0.31. For visible infarcts alone, correlations were as follows: {BI}, r=0.46; {GOS}, r=0.59; {NIHSS}, r=0.56; mortality, r=0.32.
Conclusions-Subacute {CT} infarct volume correlates moderately with 3-month clinical outcome as assessed by widely used neurological and functional assessment scales. The modesty of this linkage constrains the use of infarct volume as a surrogate end point in ischemic stroke clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Greater loss in structural integrity of the ipsilesional corticospinal tract ({CST}) is associated with poorer motor outcome in patients with hemiparetic stroke. Animal models of stroke have demonstrated that structural remodeling of white matter in the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres is associated with improved motor recovery. Accordingly, motor recovery in patients with stroke may relate to the relative strength of {CST} degeneration and remodeling. This study examined the relationship between microstructural status of brain white matter tracts, indexed by the fractional anisotropy ({FA}) metric derived from diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) data, and motor skill of the stroke-affected hand in patients with chronic stroke. Voxelwise analysis revealed that motor skill significantly and positively correlated with {FA} of the ipsilesional and contralesional {CST} in the patients. Additional voxelwise analyses showed that patients with poorer motor skill had reduced {FA} of bilateral {CST} compared to normal control subjects, whereas patients with better motor skill had elevated {FA} of bilateral {CST} compared to controls. These findings were confirmed using a {DTI}-tractography method applied to the {CST} in both hemispheres. The results of this study suggest that the level of motor skill recovery achieved in patients with hemiparetic stroke relates to microstructural status of the {CST} in both the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres, which may reflect the net effect of degeneration and remodeling of bilateral {CST}.

	abstract = {Background and Purpose- Our purpose was to determine (1) the correlation between quantitative {CT} and {MR} measurements of infarct core, penumbra, and mismatch; and (2) whether the difference between these measurements would alter patient selection for stroke clinical trials.
Methods- We studied 45 patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke imaged a mean of 3.8 hours after onset (range, 0.48 to 8.35 hours) who underwent {CT} perfusion and {MR} diffusion ({DWI})/perfusion imaging within 3 hours of each other. The {DWI} and {MR}-mean transit time ({MTT}) abnormalities were visually segmented using a semiautomated commercial analysis program. The {CT}-cerebral blood volume) and {CT}-{MTT} lesions were automatically segmented using a relative cerebral blood volume threshold of 0.56 and a relative {MTT} threshold of 1.50 on commercially available software. Percent mismatch was defined as [({MTT}-{DWI})/{DWI} volume]×100. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated.
Results- There were significant correlations for {DWI} versus {CT}-cerebral blood volume lesion volumes (r2=0.88, P{\textless}0.001), for {MR}-{MTT} versus {CT}-{MTT} lesion volumes(r2=0.86, P{\textless}0.001), and for {MR}-{MTT}/{DWI} versus {CT}-{MTT}/{CT}-cerebral blood volume mismatch lesion volumes(r2=0.81, P{\textless}0.001). {MR} perfusion and {CT} perfusion agreed for determining: (1) infarct core {\textless} versus ≥100 {mL} in 41 of 45 (91.1\%); (2) {MTT} lesion size {\textless} versus {\textgreater}2 cm diameter in 42 of 45 (93.3\%); (3) mismatch {\textless} versus {\textgreater}20\% in 41 of 45 (91.1\%); and (4) inclusion versus exclusion from trial enrollment in 38 of 45 (84.4\%) patients. Six of 7 disagreements were due to inadequate {CT} coverage.
Conclusion- Advanced {MR} and {CT} perfusion imaging measurements of core/penumbra mismatch for patient selection in stroke trials are highly correlated when {CT} perfusion coverage is sufficient to include most of the ischemic region. Although {MR} is currently the preferred imaging method for determining core and penumbra, {CT} perfusion is comparable and potentially more available.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose- Hemorrhagic transformation ({HT}) is a potentially dangerous complication of thrombolytic therapy. Recent studies suggest that diffusion-weighted {MRI} ({DWI}) can help to predict the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) after thrombolysis. We sought to examine which pretreatment {DWI} parameters and clinical data are predictive of {ICH} after intravenous thrombolysis.
Methods- We retrospectively reviewed our prospective stroke database for patients with ischemic stroke treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ({rtPA}) within 3 hours from symptom onset who had {DWI} before treatment and {MRI} with T2* sequence or {CT} 24 to 48 hours later to assess for {ICH} over the past 4 years. We measured the volumes and voxel-by-voxel apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC}) values of the initial {DWI} lesions and retrieved demographic data, risk factors, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ({NIHSS}) scores on admission, and blood tests results. We examined several variables using univariate and multivariate regression analyses to determine predictors of {ICH}.
Results- Twenty-nine patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria; 17 patients (58\%) had {ICH}, and of these 4 (13\%) had symptomatic {ICH} and fatal outcome. On univariate analysis, higher systolic blood pressure, {NIHSS} score, serum glucose level, volume of initial {DWI} lesion, and absolute number of voxels with {ADC} value ≤550×10-6 mm2/s were statistically associated with {ICH}, and all were subjected to multivariate analysis. However, only the absolute number of voxels, ie, volume of ischemic tissue on {DWI}, with {ADC} ≤550×10-6 mm2/s emerged as an independent predictor of {ICH}.
Conclusions- Our findings suggest that volumetric {ADC} analysis can be used to assess {ICH} risk after thrombolysis. This may be particularly helpful if {rtPA} is to be given outside the 3-hour window.},

Discriminant analysis of 21 parameters from the initial examination and {CT} scan, selected five factors which best separate the two groups, since 89\% of the patients were well classified. These five parameters (age, consciousness impairment, temperature, volume of the hematoma and ventricular hemorrhage) combined, give a prognostic score which gives for each patient his probability of survival or death. The validity of the proposed model was controlled on a test-sample of 66 patients from another department. The possibility of giving a trustworthy spontaneous prognosis on the first day can enable the evaluation of the possible benefit from surgery, which we illustrated with a group of 23 operated patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Mid-life stroke risk factors have been related to late-life cognitive impairment. This association may result not only from clinical strokes but also from subclinical brain injury, such as a global atrophy demonstrable on quantitative brain {MRI}.
Methods: The authors evaluated the community-based cohort of Framingham Offspring Study participants. A total of 1,841 subjects (mean age, 62 years; 857 men, 984 women) who underwent quantitative {MRI} and cognitive testing between 1999 and 2001 and were free of clinical stroke and dementia constituted our study sample. The authors used age- and sex-adjusted linear regression models to relate previous (1991 to 1995) and recent (1998 to 2001) Framingham Stroke Risk Profile ({FSRP}) scores to the total cerebral brain volume ratio ({TCBVr}) on follow-up {MRI}, and further to relate the {TCBVr} with education-adjusted scores on neuropsychological tests administered at the time of imaging.
Results: There was an inverse association between {FSRP} scores and {TCBVr}. The {TCBVr} also showed a significant positive association with performance on tests of attention (Trails A), executive function (Trails B), and visuospatial function (visual reproduction, Hooper visual organization), but not with performance on tests of verbal memory or naming.
Conclusions: The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile may identify subjects with smaller brains and poorer cognitive function among stroke- and dementia-free subjects, reinforcing the importance of managing stroke risk factors.},

Methods: Spontaneous eyes-closed and eyes-open {EEG} were recorded at 128 electrodes in 20 children aged 6-11 years and 23 adults aged 18-23 years. The surface Laplacian algorithm was applied to improve the spatial resolution of each electrode. Power and coherence were used to characterize the spatial structure of the alpha rhythm. A stochastic field model was used to eliminate coherences that are inflated due to volume conduction.
Results: In adults, the alpha rhythm is characterized by very high coherence between distant electrodes. The children demonstrated reduced anterior power and coherence between anterior and posterior electrodes at the peak alpha frequency in comparison to the adults. The Laplacian alpha rhythm demonstrated much higher power in the children at both anterior and posterior electrodes, but was weakly correlated between electrodes.
Conclusions: The maturation of neocortex in late childhood involves increased global correlation by long-range corticocortical connections. The local correlation that contributes power to each electrode, independent of other electrodes, is reduced as the global correlation increases.},

We compare four proposed measures of voxel similarity using the same optimization scheme when presented with 10 pairs of images with a range of initial misregistrations. The registration estimates are compared with those provided by manual point-based registration and evaluated by visual inspection to give an assessment of the robustness and accuracy of the different measures. One full-volume {CT} image set is used to investigate the performance of each measure when used to align truncated images from different regions in the head. The soft tissue correlation and mutual information measures were found to provide the most robust measures of misregistration, providing results comparable to or better than those from manual point-based registration for all but the most truncated image volumes.},

One hundred patients were separately interviewed by two physicians in different combinations. The degree of handicap was recorded by each observer on the modified Rankin scale, which has six grades (0-5). The agreement rates were corrected for chance (kappa statistics). Both physicians agreed on the degree of handicap in 65 patients; they differed by one grade in 32 patients and by two grades in 3 patients. Kappa for all pairwise observations was 0.56; the value for weighted kappa (with quadratic disagreement weights) was 0.91. Our results confirm the value of the modified Rankin scale in the assessment of handicap in stroke patients; nevertheless, further improvements are possible.},

The contiguous binary brain mask obtained by the new algorithm is shown to be more effective than the ones obtained by the commonly deployed masking algorithms. The introduced algorithm can also be applied to different image modalities that need to be registered to the space of anatomy or to the native space of echo planar images.},

	abstract = {Background The purpose of this study was to define the incidence, imaging characteristics, natural history, and prognostic implication of corticospinal tract Wallerian degeneration ({CST}‐{WD}) in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) using serial {MR} imaging.
Methods and Results Consecutive {ICH} patients with supratentorial {ICH} prospectively underwent serial {MRIs} at 2, 7, 14, and 21 days. {MRIs} were analyzed by independent raters for the presence and topographical distribution of {CST}‐{WD} on diffusion‐weighted imaging ({DWI}). Baseline demographics, hematoma characteristics, {ICH} score, and admission National Institute of Health Stroke Score ({NIHSS}) were systematically recorded. Functional outcome at 3 months was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale ({mRS}) and the motor‐{NIHSS}. Twenty‐seven patients underwent 93 {MRIs}; 88 of these were serially obtained in the first month. In 13 patients (48\%), all with deep {ICH}, {CST}‐{WD} changes were observed after a median of 7 days (interquartile range, 7 to 8) as reduced diffusion on {DWI} and progressed rostrocaudally along the {CST}. {CST}‐{WD} changes evolved into T2‐hyperintense areas after a median of 11 days (interquartile range, 6 to 14) and became atrophic on {MRIs} obtained after 3 months. In univariate analyses, the presence of {CST}‐{WD} was associated with poor functional outcome (ie, {mRS} 4 to 6; P=0.046) and worse motor‐{NIHSS} (5 versus 1, P=0.001) at 3 months.
Conclusions Wallerian degeneration along the {CST} is common in spontaneous supratentorial {ICH}, particularly in deep {ICH}. It can be detected 1 week after {ICH} on {DWI} and progresses rostrocaudally along the {CST} over time. The presence of {CST}‐{WD} is associated with poor motor and functional recovery after {ICH}.},

	abstract = {1.Researchers frequently take repeated measurements of individuals in a sample with the goal of quantifying the proportion of the total variation that can be attributed to variation among individuals vs. variation among measurements within individuals. The proportion of the variation attributed to variation among individuals is known as repeatability and is most frequently estimated as the intraclass correlation coefficient ({ICC}). The goal of our study is to provide guidelines for determining the sample size (number of individuals and number of measurements per individual) required to accurately estimate the {ICC}. 2. We report a range of {ICCs} from the literature and estimate 95\% confidence intervals for these estimates. We introduce a predictive equation derived by Bonett (2002), and we test the assumptions of this equation through simulation. Finally, we create an R statistical package for the planning of experiments and estimation of {ICCs}. 3. Repeatability estimates were reported in 1·5\% of the articles published in the journals surveyed. Repeatabilities tended to be highest when the {ICC} was used to estimate measurement error and lowest when it was used to estimate repeatability of behavioural and physiological traits. Few authors report confidence intervals, but our estimated 95\% confidence intervals for published {ICCs} generally indicated a low level of precision associated with these estimates. This survey demonstrates the need for a protocol to estimate repeatability. 4. Analysis of the predictions from Bonett's equation over a range of sample sizes, expected repeatabilities and desired confidence interval widths yields both analytical and intuitive guidelines for designing experiments to estimate repeatability. However, we find a tendency for the confidence interval to be underestimated by the equation when {ICCs} are high and overestimated when {ICCs} and the number of measurements per individual are low. 5. The sample size to use when estimating repeatability is a question pitting investigator effort against expected precision of the estimate. We offer guidelines that apply over a wide variety of ecological and evolutionary studies estimating repeatability, measurement error or heritability. Additionally, we provide the R package, icc, to facilitate analyses and determine the most economic use of resources when planning experiments to estimate repeatability.},

	abstract = {Wallerian degeneration of the corticospinal tract ({CST}) after motor pathway ischemic stroke can be characterized by diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}). However, the dynamic evolution of the diffusion indices in the degenerated {CST} has not previously been completely identified. We investigated this dynamic evolution and the relationship between early changes of the diffusion indices in the degenerated {CST} and long-term clinical outcomes. {DTI} and neurological examinations were performed repeatedly in 9 patients with first-onset motor pathway subcortical infarction at 5 consecutive time points, i.e. within 1 week, at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months and 1 year. Using a region of interest method, we analyzed the ratios of the fractional anisotropy ({rFA}), mean diffusivity ({rMD}), primary eigenvalue (rλ1) and transverse eigenvalue (rλ23) between the affected and unaffected sides of the {CSTs}. We did not find any significant changes in the diffusion indices of the contralesional {CSTs} across time points. The {rFA} decreased monotonously during the first 3 months and then stabilized. The {rMD} increased after 2 weeks and stabilized after the third month. The rλ1 decreased during the first 2 weeks and then remained unchanged. The rλ23 increased during the first 3 months and then stabilized. We also found that the changes in the {rFA} between the first 2 time points were correlated with the {NIHSS} (P = 0.00003) and the Motricity Indices (P = 0.0004) after 1 year. Our results suggest that for patients with motor pathway stroke the diffusion indices in the degenerated {CST} stabilize within 3 months and that early changes in the {rFA} of the {CST} may predict long-term clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background

In adults, intraventricular thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ({rtPA}) facilitates resolution of intraventricular haemorrhage ({IVH}), reduces intracranial pressure, decreases duration of cerebrospinal fluid diversion, and may ameliorate direct neural injury. We hypothesize that patients with small parenchymal haematoma volumes ({\textless}30 cc) and relatively large {IVH} causing acute obstructive hydrocephalus would have improved clinical outcomes when given injections of low-dose {rtPA} to accelerate lysis and evacuation of {IVH} compared with placebo.


Methods

The Clot Lysis Evaluation of Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage {III} trial is an investigator-initiated, phase {III}, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the use of external ventricular drainage ({EVD}) combined with intraventricular injection of {rtPA} to {EVD} plus intraventricular injection of normal saline (placebo) for the treatment of {IVH}. Patients with known symptom onset within 24 h of the computed tomography scan confirmed {IVH} and third or fourth ventricle obstruction, with or without supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage volume {\textless}30 cc, who require {EVD} are screened with a computed tomography scan at least six hours after {EVD} placement and, if necessary, at consecutive 12-h intervals until stabilization of any intracranial bleeding has been established. Patients who meet clinical and imaging criteria (no ongoing coagulopathy and no suspicion of aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or any other vascular anomaly) will be randomized to either intraventricular {rtPA} or placebo.


Results

The primary outcome measure is dichotomized modified Rankin Scale 0-3 vs. 4-6 at 180 days. Clinical secondary outcomes include additional modified Rankin Scale dichotomizations at 180 days (0-4 vs. 5-6), ordinal modified Rankin Scale (0-6), mortality and safety events at 30 days, mortality at 180 days, functional status measures, type and intensity of intensive care unit management, rate and extent of ventricular blood clot removal, and quality of life measures.},
